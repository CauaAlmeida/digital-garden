@sjw I'd Smash.

@sjw No idea how I missed that.

@sjw From where did you hear of this?

#FSE #NormieChatsStart a new series of debates called "Normie Chats." Here's to the 2nd conversation! As in the last instance I cleaned it, abridged it, and the like as much as possible.Turning social media into a "public utility" is a bad idea because it gives the false impression that the first amendment would automatically apply to said platforms.However, this requires Congress to pass new laws, likely infringing upon existing freedom of speech and future judicial interpretations; ultimately not preventing a state controlled social media from banning individuals based upon interpretation of said speech laws. If the Right tries to be too clever with reinterpreting the legal status of social media, it's going to backfire.Solutions that rely on changing the status of social media to a publisher or a utility don't work. Simply because as long as leftist organizations control mainstream culture these social media companies turned publisher will turn into leftist lawsuit generators overnight. Solutions that go even further and turn them into utilities will hand control of these organizations over to a Congressional committee, thus giving the ban hammer to the most recent election winners. Both solutions are too underhanded and neither solution addresses the root problem.In order to end online social media censorship laws setting hard limits on how many people can be banned at one time and requiring the criteria behind each ban to be published by the corporation would do better. More indirect solutions like turning social media into a publisher leave things open to gaming of the system, and more broad and radical solutions like the nationalization of social media just give the government the potential to censor instead of silicon valley corporations, increasing the scope for bias and tyranny even further. The only solution that will actually produce the desired results is to directly regulate social media's ability to censor and ban. It has to be that straightforward or it isn't going to work.

@rasterman I'm not even a little concerned. If they want to come in and mock us they can feel free to do so. Odds are they won't though.

@rasterman I'll look for another normie comment, clean it up and post it now.How's the tag NormieChats sound?

@rasterman We are still in that free trade debate and it has taken some interesting turns. Maybe something like: how to deal with internet censorship, should social media be publishers, who is paying the taxes and why, prison systems and representation, Euro US comparative violent crime rates and stats, stuff like that.

I kind of like the whole concept of: debating normie ideas until they trickle-down towards something useful. Maybe #NormieDebate should be an FSE series?

@Prodigal @judgedread @amerika :trump_mad: THIS IS NOW AN AMERICAN THREAD! :trump_mad: > (unless massive tax breaks) <Agreed. Let's cut taxes for business doing a majority of their business - production and employment wise - within the US and increase it for those doing the inverse. There can be exceptions to certain industries or certain circumstances; but as a general rule I see no issue with lowering these taxes IF it is tied to such factors.> Trump tariffing the basic materials needed to create the goods and services stateside <Let's produce those materials in the US when possible! If not possible, I understand not tariffing.

@Prodigal @amerika @judgedread You didn't really prove why tariffs are bad. You just keep asserting it. I am firmly against growing dependent upon foreign powers.How would one buy up natural resources? Are you suggesting some sort of economic collectivism? Who will be doing the buying and with whose money?Reuniting Korea sounds like a neocon/neolib war of aggression that can only end poorly. You want war with China? That's probably a great way to accomplish that. Korea can deal with Korea. I question the wisdom of the bases we currently have in S Korea.Trading with Russia seems entirely reasonable. A stronger Russia would surely help reign in the Chinese as well. Russia is by no means a friend, but their is no reason for them to be an enemy either.What are tariffs if not penalties China is facing for their actions? You specify coming up with a penalty, but offer none. I see tariffs as a perfectly reasonable penalty which should help bring some industry back to the US/applicable country.TL;DR: 1 - Maybe; 2 - No; 3 - Yes; 4 - Agreed.

@Prodigal Also, how likely is it China will come bomb us? Do you view this as a reasonable or likely response? Is this one of the alternatives you were suggesting?@amerika @judgedread

@Prodigal I'll admit - forgot about that one.Regardless, there are plenty of other factors than just soy.And last I checked open, free trade mixed with MASSIVE outsourcing your heavy industry to competitors is not an effective means of punishing them. You can't give your enemy a sword to wave over your head and then wonder why they can keep fucking you.@amerika @judgedread

@Jdogg247 Learning rhetoric from Hillary I see.

@Prodigal @judgedread "Who is going to buy soy at 25%" Who is placing this tarriff of 25% on soy?  Seriously, explain this statement as it makes LITTLE sense and I see mo context.Free trade or else you get bombed? This may be the gayest take that I've ever seen you post. I know you can do better.@amerika

@byllgrim @wjmaggos @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight You ever ask for citations on the benefits of "Diversity" or any other multiculti BS?You can easily search this shit yourself and the Quaran is not their only book. I'm not going to post stuff for you to ignore and say "doesn't matter because #NAXALT."

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @AtlasFreeman @wjmaggos Anti-discrimination laws shouldn't exist in the first place. Don't make an exception.

@wjmaggos @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Their religion explicitly tells them to lie in order to gain trust until they can dominate. Tell me how you can tell who is honest and who is not among people who follow such an ideology.

@wjmaggos @AtlasFreeman @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight You are asking different questions. Conversion to any idea or religion will be far lower as proximity to practitioners decreases. Religion is already dying out in the Western world, I don't see a new religion historically at odds with freedom and traditional Western values as catching on among Western peoples.We can outlaw halal, circumcision, have weekly parodies of Mohammad - just to name a few - on the front page of every newspaper. There are plenty of ways to mock and make life unbearable for Muslims within our civilization. Make it so they cannot live here and they will not come and conversion will be that much less realistic or possible.

@ArdanianRight @wjmaggos @AtlasFreeman @ChristiJunior I got an easy way to prevent Islamic terrorism: don't let any Muslims in, and near no Islamic terrorism will occur in these areas.I cite Europe: the difference between terrorist attacks in Western Europe and Eastern Europe.

@Prodigal This is a great argument against immigration. Importing an entirely dependent underclass with a completely different culture and history is trouble in the waiting. Manufacturing will always need people, but most likely not as many and those that remain will need to be more highly trained.But as @judgedread stated: shortening work weeks, closing borders, and putting up tariffs would make such a transition to such an economic model infinitely less painful. @amerika

@Jdogg247 He just doxxed people by revealing their phone numbers.He needs to be banned.

@jack @ArdanianRight Acting still means they have to break from norms to keep from becoming irrelevant. Gradualism is a thing.Their fuck ups entirely depend on how well they can be exploited. Even HAVING TO FUND an alternative is a loss for them. How long until that need to censor as well? How long until the main message there is sterile? There isn't enough money in the world to hide behind forever.I'm interested in this very specific 93% die-off scenario. Do go on.

@ArdanianRight A classic.

@levi @swagchen A literal gay take.

@augustus Hopefully a fertility festival where the end goal is pregnancy.

@ArdanianRight Who even thinks about Anglin? Is he even alive? Who gives a fuck.They openly defended Paul Nehlen. I'm not going to say they are on our side, but they are big enough to cause disruption and seem more focused on "triggering the libs" than anything else. That's a blindspot.

@jack @ArdanianRight "Financiers will just invest to cover losses." - Sounds completely profit driven to me.Sure Fox is run a bunch of globohomos. Rupert Murdoch is like a come to lufe James Bond villain. But a couple veer dangerously close to leaving the reservation. It's those few who could if pushed actually facilitate normies getting angry at the right places.Listen I know you think Jews meet in small Moloch chambers every full moon and discuss the Kabbalah and cut the foreskin of young goyim who they then eat in ritualistic, Talmudic ceromony. But the Jews are just as dumb as everyone else. They are far from infalliable and their neuroticism will force them to fund opposition in the misguided ideal that they are somehow controlling it.

@bbhack Correction: the first time a gay "person" of melanin is hit by a milkshake it will become both illegal and a hate crime.I'm think it will be either AOC or Omar - although Ben Shapiro is a close 3rd best option.

@ArdanianRight They may not want to, but who do you think their most popular content creators will be? How many of them do you think will police themselves even a little less before uploading?We've learned that the slippery slope is real - exploit it.

@RicottaJust imagine sleeping in the middle of the woods and as you're lying down you see eyes outside your window qnd then a click of the front door.So much horror potential!@Boco @march

@sjw Personally I think we should be congratulating ourselves rather than the ZOG. All of us mocking them is why they backed off. They would rather have anything be legal than for it to be illegal and for us to ignore their authority on it. Because once they lose authority on one dumb restriction it's a very short trip to losing all legitimacy as people realize most of the other restrictions don't matter either. I have it on good authority this is why they started legalizing weed in Oregon and Washington. They were starting to get worried about their ability to control the population since no one there cared it was a felony to grow it or sell it and just did so anyways.

@ArdanianRight Fox should get more aggressive. Of all media companies they are among the few that could successfully make an alternative that will put right-wing normies in direct proximity with WN.Even if they are mostly milquetoast they are 100% profit driven, so it could be interesting.

@p @oneway Honestly: no dressing like a slut and no niggers sounds pretty good to me.Why did you you have to go and make him sound so cool? I now 100% hope his system scales better than fedi!

@Secftblgirl "Legit journalists" - this is inherently contradictory.

@ArdanianRight So Fox News is no longer welcome on JewTube I see.

@noyoushutthefuckupdadClearly this was added to target based Indians. Fucking BIGOTS!@ArdanianRight @cereal @rasterman

@MadokaMeowgica I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding. Also, this seems like a good opportunity for a photo reveal. Here's a picture of me with my gf. I met her at summer camp. She lives in Canada. She goes to a different school so you don't know her.DXNQz_fPDQNadg.jpg

Niggers got no reason to live.

@PussySlayer @Lanfear Crowder's ability to trigger people by being milquetoast is his charm.Imagine if you will a world where you tell a blue hair there are only 2 sexes and she calls the police. That's every day for Crowder.

@judgedread I'm talking to these people in person, in Asia. There is nothing stopping them.

@wjmaggos @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @judgedread I'm not quite certain, the wording is a little strange so I'm just saying what it reads like.

@wjmaggos @judgedread @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight This statement seems to imply that you feel the impetus is on the host population to integrate into those coming into our societies - or at the very least into SJW outrage/suicide culture - rather than the other way around.

@wjmaggosThat's argument is not sufficient to opening up the flood gates for these people. Anyone could easily just go to vacation in that area if they wanted to learn of that culture, but because they hail from shitholes - which they thenselves created - nobody seems interested. So why do we want to bring the shithole here?Does Freedom of Association not exist in your reality? If we are not free to maintain our own: borders, businesses, or neighborhoods how exactly are we free? Let alone with the increased continued need for "tolerance" as "Diversity" increases the speech restrictions and limits to an individual's freedom to associate diminishes as well.@judgedread @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight

@PussySlayer @alcade Embrace physical currency! It's harder to track! It also costs the government money to mint. Win-Win.

@PussySlayer @p I could go for a small island community. Net, farms, beaches, etc. I bet you since "100% of islands are sinking in 10 years" we can buy up an island before Al Gore mysteriously buys them all with carbon credits.

@nik I know the feeling - in a bit of it now. Just keep pushing, it's all you can do.

@wjmaggos @judgedread @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior At the end of the day diversity breeds conflict. Furthermore, it's not anyone's job other than their own to improve their attitude and livelihood.We are not required to sacrifice our cultures and way of life to improve theirs, nor are they entitled to us handing our centuries old nations to them.

@wjmaggos @judgedread Why can't they go back to their countries? Access to our country is not a human right.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @forte @rasterman Most characters I play can kill him from edge around 40 - those Levin airs are deadly - so I don't mind him too much.

@forte @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @rasterman I hate Palutena as I usually play Robin or Link. Whenever someone chooses her I just go Roy and grab her all day!

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @forte @rasterman Without his avatar he has trouble killing. He can combo you for 50-80% and do nothing important.

@judgedread @PussySlayer You like to say that, but the attitudes here are still better than much of Europe.Don't get me wrong I'm already outtie, but I still think the US has a chance. Percentage of the population doesn't matter if the will to resist doesn't exist. A large percentage of Europeans are worthless and lost to the ideals of egalitarianism.Old, White liberals in the US are further right than most center-right Whites in Europe. It's sad, but true. The shitholes we border are also not as bad as the shitholes that Europe borders.

@judgedread Exactly. So why would this kind of weak rhetoric succeed? I just see amnesty in the future. Every German I've spoken with supports these people "integrating" and staying. It's like they have no will to win, no desire to resist globohomo.

@judgedread Here's hoping. Considering their best rhetoric against them staying is currently Reaganite "Christian values" memes regarding "integration" and the insistence that "all is fine if they become productive" I don't hold much hope.

@judgedread @PussySlayer When 40% of your population is not "your population" and many of your leftist and even "center-right" party members think that "anyone can be German" and are so worried about looking racist - does such a technicality matter?1 Amnesty, and BOOM! I mean we still have yet to overturn our Reagan fuck up- and look at the millions that brought in. Germany is just 1 "RADICAL CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIC REVOLUTIONARY" away from a mass amnesty. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if Merkel had a plan in the works before she departs.

@judgedread @PussySlayer Germany would have to go full King Judah considering around 40% of children are now "migrants."

@ArdanianRight Let's just hope these movements supplant the cucks.

@judgedread @PussySlayer Except for France, Germany, Sweden, and the Low Countries. They are MUCH WORSE.

@Terry I just want you to do well and avoid the hellscape. Don't be a bitch.

@PussySlayer @Lanfear HELL YEAH BROTHER! #HH

@Terry I moved over 6000 miles away into a country where I am an obscure minority who is still learning the language. I have that experience tenfold.The fact that you've done it before means that you know what needs be done and will do even better if you choose to do it again.

@Lanfear BURN FOSSIL FUELS FASTER! I'M TALKING COAL POWERED CAR ENGINES!

@Terry Only you can find the willpower to improve your situation. I somehow doubt you're making much more than $15/hr now, so even 13 would be worth it if you take into account cost of living.Do what makes sense for you, but I'd hate to see you go mad in a developing shithole.

@sjw @jack @march @pea @vix Getting better. :trump:

@Terry 1) Seek one. 2) Apply. 3) Get Job.4) Move.You can do it. Factory jobs are popping up in the Midwest. It'll take time, but it's better than being dominated by the degenerate city-state of Chicago.@bigl0af @bigl0af

@Terry If you get employed there just move. What is binding you to Illinois? I mean I high-tailed it 6000 miles away man. Your attitude is your limit. BE AN AMERICAN! TAKE RISKS! SEEK FREEDOM!@bigl0af @bigl0af

@matrix My only critique of that anime is that it is a supposed "matriarchy," but all the relevant villains are prominent men.It would honestly be better if there were competent female villains. The female protagonists are awesome, but the female villains are definitely lacking -  yes, the thot is terrible, but she is a literal butt-monkey.People shit-talking this show have NO IDEA what the anime is about. I uniroically hope they all get falsely accused of rape and cry about it on social media.

@Terry Have you considered NOT living in Illinois? Pertaining to Trump, I'm hoping he doesn't cuck on this like he did bumpstocks. There is no reasoning with these animals, nearly everyone knows this, he can stop trying to extend the olive branch.@bigl0af @bigl0af

@yolo @wowaname FREEDOM!!!image.png

@Lanfear That's pretty fucking sad.

@Jdogg247 Oddly related to our recent conversation. I guess we'll see what people think or if anyone has something intelligible to say about it in the mainstream.

@1iceloops123 @ThePotato @oshwm @p Who cares what they call you? I just don't want to encourage - or at least didn't - stuff that will inevitably fail because it's so fucking retarded a 3 year old could tell you it was a bad idea.Fear is the biggest factor here. Say what you want in public. Some gay Eurofags were talking about politics - because that's all they do - and mentioned how they were so happy for this candidate supporting gay marriage and trannie shit like it's a big fucking deal. I just say "Yeah anal sex and pondering if I should cut my dick off are among my top priorities too." He didn't know what to say, they aren't used to being opposed. Everyone is so browbeaten because all the Nosesteins on the TV tell them this shit is normal, healthy, and good. Anyone so brainwashed as to cut ties over such comments are worthless. Don't lie or hide yourself to maintain superficial connections.

@p :trump: You're cute. You know I don't oppose you trying. :trumpkiss:

@ThePotato @1iceloops123 @oshwm @p Well I was using the world democracy to encompass society and culture as well.Let it fall. If you can find a way to get out or somehow get to a position of fixing shit after the fact do it, but fuck this system. You don't owe it or the screaming chickwithdickinteracialcuckoldgaytranniebabyjewfaggots anything. Do what's good for yourself and your family. The toxic retards running society don't deserve anything from you: not your labor, not your loyalty, and certainly not your life.

@p We only wish it were that simple. :mcafeesmug3:

@p @1iceloops123 @ThePotato @oshwm I think once you reach the point of "disagree with me and it's over" regarding politics it's a pretty good sign that your democracy is fucked.

@jack @sjw @march @vix Journalists and information "professionals" are taught - as @pea stated - that bias in unavoidable. Most professors do teach you the (((correct))) biases and most who go into that profession were already susceptible to this type of influence.

@sjw @jack @march @pea @vix It's not "journalists" it's (((journalists))). Learn to dog whistle effectively fag!

@Prodigal There will never be a society in which 100% or likely even a large majority of the population will be technocrats. There is always a bottom and people frequently overestimate the effects of automation against the increase in demand for human labor. However, you can form a technocratic class or sub-group - whether that be upper, middle, or otherwise - within nearly any society.Do you disagree with this assessment?In regards to the remainder of your post: I can see how it relates to the topic at hand, but it's kind of diverting from the core argument. I'm interested in the topic, but maybe we could really nail down the main points of the discussion?

@Feuerfuchs @nosleep They REALLY WANT you to use pirated versions of their product. They will sue the shit out of you IF you manage to make any money using it. They aren't dumb, they designed it to be easily piratable for this purpose.

@Terry Did you see the response regarding their views on whether or not Israel can remain a Jewish state while simultaneously remaining a democracy in conjunction with their views of what being Jewish means? A little suspicious and hypocritical don't you think?

@amerika So what's your take on the conversation so far? In regards to OP and @Prodigal  response and the current rebuttal?International Free Trade = Yes / NoProtectionist Policies = Yes / NoWhy or why not? I know you are more than capable of producing an inspiring answer, you're a pretty good writer.@judgedread

@amerika @Prodigal @judgedread I'm not an advocate of socialism.

@Terry Got to archive.org this stuff. The Jews delete things.https://web.archive.org/web/20190503055808/ajc.org/news/survey2018

@Prodigal @judgedread There will always be serfs, there will always be peasants, and there will always be the employed. Even the situation which you described demands this remain true.The question is whether or not a middle class is to continue to exist. The whole point of capitalism is profit. Don't use flowery language to pretend that "the whole point of capitalism" is to give the most hungry, most resourceful person the ability to float to the owner class, because it is not. I am not passing a moral argument there, just stating a fact. There is no ideal to it other than profit.The issue with international free trade is that it allows nations to become nothing more than landing pads for big business. I have 0 issue with vastly rolling back all regulations within my homeland, but I do have issue seeing factory jobs go to China. A nation that produces nothing can only float on artificial money supplies for so long. Your personal, anecdotal story is sweet and I'm happy for you, but it doesn't change the reality that international free trade is THE BIGGEST engine behind globalism. International free trade complete erodes culture, completely erodes social cohesion, and all but ensures the middle class disappears. I'm certain that a good 5-10% of these people will do as you say and make something wonderful of themselves, the others will become surfs. Not everybody can be a suit, that's just a fact of life.

@ArdanianRight You stated that so simply and elegantly it's almost like you're not to paid to sit around and make economics more difficult.Whenever someone mentions avocados or bananas, pick your produce, I just think: couldn't we just lower the sales tax on those items - for X period of time - to lessen or eliminate any possible hits to the domestic consumer? Why is nobody making this argument?

"Free trade is good. Just make policy better for business friendly environments and businesses won’t leave. Tariffs destroy their ability to compete, make everything more expense for Americans and the tariff is a tax on American consumers."-Anonymous RetardI cleaned up the grammar, style, and spelling of this random post quite a bit, but didn't want it to lose it's original meaning so it's still shit.Discuss.

@ArdanianRightI too feel bad for niggers.You realize Gargoy has us instance blocked right?@Gargron

@ArdanianRightTHE GERMANS ARE THE REAL RACISTS! What an argument. :putin_laugh: @Gargron

@DashEquals @meowski He is absolutely right though - Places like China and India don't have heavy, dirty industry because they're forced to at gunpoint, they chose to because it makes money. There are several countries with a big income from outsourced industry that take care to be up to standard in environmental protection, I live in one of them.China was extremely industrialistic, by what the tech of the time allowed, back when Europe was using rowing boats as their main sea transport method. The most advanced tech of the time was bronze and they were already completely disregarding the environment and their own people to keep up their military and economic supremacy over eastern Asia.India most likely glassed itself with nuclear weapons in prehistoric times, the level of advancement they had in ancient times absolutely does not match their modern civilization, so either the indigenous population left and the current population are squatters, or they managed to kill most of the smart people they had. Either way they were destroying their forests and rivers at least as far back as the moghul empire.As for africa, you can see how much its population cares about their land by looking at any non-white-controlled region of the continent: the only case I can remember of them doing something for their environment was a recent attempt to reforest the sahara. Erecting a dam on the Nile and destroying the floodplain ecosystem that had sustained the region for thousand of years and causing themselves a famine in the process is also a good example of the lack of forethought and concern they have, and you can't blame it on Europeans as it was a local enterprise to get electrical independenceThe fact of the matter is that while European and european-diaspora countries are nowhere near perfect in their attempts at being ecologically sustainable, they're the only countries in the world that are developed and can claim to at least be trying to reduce their ecological impact. Countries elsewhere are either too technologically undeveloped to make a big dent, or altogether don't care about the damage they do to their regions.Colonialism and international pressure only goes so far, and it can only be enforced in tiny regions: any geographically big country with a meaningful population can choose if they want to follow the suggestions of a foreign power or do what they want. The UN is toothless, and colonialism nowadays is reduced to sending a few intelligence guys to bribe politicians and pushing propaganda. Anyone who is not stupid can plainly ignore that, and populations that choose to buy into it have only themselves to blame.And you could simply stop outsourcing from western, wealthy countries, but then those same countries would be blamed for the collapse of the economies of the countries that relied on that outsourcing. If every move is a losing move, you can't blame the player.

@swagchenimage.png

@swagchen Enjoying your sassy posts. The sheer salt your simple comments produce never cease to amuse me :laughing_cirno:

@judgedread Imagine having to take a concept like ableism seriously. Guaranteed to fail.

@judgedread @brainblasted Perhaps the moniker: braindead, would better describe this ape.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Pitting Hispanics and Blacks against each other politically would be ideal. Even supporting a full on Black or Hispanic oriented third party could be worthwhile. It could lose the Demonrats vital votes at the national/state level, at the expense of a few local seats in Southern states. The areas these parties take over would probably quickly become shitholes - see Flint, MI - and depending on how this is exploited could be useful.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Blacks are consistently against immigration, but still vote for candidates that support mass immigration because they get free shit. There is no reason that this trend will not continue as Hispanics flood in.Irish/Italians - dirty potato/meatball niggers though they may be - are a far cry from the Ameridian hordes pouring over the border. I'm hardly convinced the Irish genome is really Irish so much as it is English at this point - and thus were easily assimilatable, and Italians came in such small numbers that they too were absorbed quickly. "Italian-Americans" look and act CONSIDERABLY more Anglo than their native Italian counterparts.The difference in genetics, culture, and numbers of the current "immigrants" is not even comparable to the 2 you offered. You are correct that there are multiple scenarios which could play out, but when you're preemptively playing to do damage control rather than to win you decrease the chances of accomplishing either, regardless how things play out.

@benisnotreal @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Faster change always leads to faster conflict. The quicker conflict occurs, often the stronger the divisions created by the said conflict last.Brazil is a shithole, and assuming nothing is done to stop the golobohomo it will be  BEST CASE SCENARIO. When becoming a shithole that manages to not entirely implode is your best case you are doing it wrong.

@jack @Secftblgirl Fair points. CNN acknowledged and did not immediately try to hide it, he had coworkers - meaning that he was employed, and his name was pronounceable. This last one is the least powerful as many nogs have adopted normal names in order to appear less niggardly; but the first 2 are very strong indicators that the shooter could, indeed, have been HUWHITE.

@moonman I'm glad that I only know 2 of those fags.

@Secftblgirl All the news stories hide the shooter's identity, confirmed not a White male. If it were his face and name would be on national news already.



@judgedread @noyoushutthefuckupdad @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @ThreeOneThreeChris Cantwell is a fucking nutter. Saying the guy has a hair trigger is an understatement.Why are we even talking about that faggot?

@jack What is this? I read the links, but I am confused.

@HonkeyKong The exact reverse is true.@Jdogg247

The reason the "Left" always wins is because, typically, they do not care who their messenger is, what he says, or how dumb he may look, only that he falls in line with their mainstream ideals - and ignore all else.Everyone who purports to be on the right - especially the lolspergertarians - constantly attack Right-wing messengers, politicians, personalities NOT because they are not fighting for them, but because they ARE NOT pursuing the line of discussion allowed by the enemy media.Stop fighting with the intent to win over an enemy who wants nothing more than your destruction. Stop pretending that these people are arguing in good faith. Stop conflating (((optics))) with what the mainstream media and big tech conglomerates consider to be (((acceptable public dialogue))).The Right wing politician who espouses any not globohomo position in a manner that is in accordance with MSM (((optics))) doesn't exist. Stop demanding our politicians cuck to the Leftist narrative and then crying that they aren't fixing things. Stop crying that you are so "oppressed" for being a cracker and then being completely unwilling to do anything which may offend or hurt another group. Stop crying that someone on the right said something that you found (((offensive))) and start looking at the effects of the Left's actions are ACTUALLY DOING!

@Terry @ArdanianRight @Jdogg247 Agreed and amplified comrades! Paul Nehlen is an evil racist! How dare he say the mean race words! I think Mexico and America should eliminate the border and become the same country! How dare he stand against sending more troops to die in the Middle East for Israel's benefit!#Globalism #NiggerPower #IsraelFirst

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @rasterman Still not sold that they are worthwhile, and it's not like they invented those foods.What's the point of Olympic golds gifted by other people? The spirit of the Olympics was to serve as a competition between various peoples, not see who can recruit outsiders to play for them.The whole attitude of competitive sports is so dumb these days. Look at the world cup: the Western European nations just pick guys from the former colonies and say "hurr our blacks are better fed than yours!"

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @rasterman Got some big black benefits for us?

@yolo @tai Her choice is gay.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @rasterman Are you saying that you see no benefit to gypsies? What a bigot!

@benisnotreal @chara So you must love California for housing all those illegal aliens. This is possibly your gayest take yet.

@chara "...the pot kettle calling the paper plate a nigger." I'm going to try incorporating this one into my everyday lexicon.



@benisnotreal @chara Southerners prefer the company of "human" livestock so...

@jack I'd only argue that if you're actively helping the terrorist avoid authorities or commit crimes while talking to him that you are guilty.Otherwise Solid Post.

@grips @solidsanek Just post. I tried being all calm, reasonable, non-larpy, but had no fun.Sure sometimes I like to be serious, but if you can't BS what's the point?Maybe an alt for troll, shitpost, larp would help? Then you don't have to worry about appearences so much on your main.

@benisnotreal I heard a lot of black male slaves had some pretty stretched asses. I'm not convinced.

@i @Agni That's the only time in which to operate.

@ThreeOneThreeChris @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @u Where's Christianity fit in here? White Blood cells?

@judgedread @ArdanianRight @one @radicalrobit @simba Most Western Buddhists seem to find it trendy and safe. They have no issue bashing Islam or Christianity - but we know they won't bash the 3rd Abrahamic cancer - and seem to take solace in the fact that nobody knows anything about Buddhism and thus cannot point out their hypocrisy.

@simba @one @radicalrobit @judgedread @Gargron @wowaname You can't prove or disprove the existence of God. Agnosticism is an infinitely more logical choice than Atheism. But you have shown that you're definitely willing to direct hatred "THEY MUST BE ELIMINATED!"

@byllgrim @comzeradd @alexl Just let them remove all steam valves for angry reactionaries. Let them force things like Charlottesville to be the only way for these people to speak.It has always ended well historically when you remove all peaceful options for people to express themselves.

@ChristiJunior @ThreeOneThreeChris @ArdanianRight @u Jews have done and will continue to do far more damage than Muslims can hope to do.

@chara @benisnotreal The MAGApede trannies are coming. They will cry about the racism, and the homophobia, and muh mean words. They'll probably block themselves off like the #Q tards.

@chara That guy is the epitome of larperspergatarianism. He never debates, he just tosses gay shit at you and then proclaims victory when you inevitable realize how utterly intellectual worthless he is.@leyonhjelm @Gargron

@chara @benisnotreal I think Gargoy has some issues with it.

@Breakfast @karolat Imagine thinking something such a "systematic racism" exists as an invisible barrier to keep black people down, despite the numerous programs in place designed to specifically help them at the expense of Whites. This ignoring the fact taht nobody who ever makes this argument can ever actually provide any information, resources, instances, or anything else to back up these claims.Just state it as fact until nobody challenges you. Then just presume victory because you were left unchallenged. That is literally the precedent these moronic egalitarian absolutists are setting.

@benisnotreal You Southerners and your desire to turn people into laborers instead of physically removing them is problematic.@Ricotta @RehnSturm256

@Breakfast How many Whites do you think have been denied jobs at Chinese restaurants because of this exact kind of bigotry? Your complicity with this racist attitude is exactly why China is able to actively genocide Tibet, and quite possibly the British Columbia in the near future!There is no such thing as "reverse racism" just racism! Stop qualifying, that's what bigots do!#SilenceIsNotOK #NoRoomForHatred #Racism

@ArdanianRight Doubtful, Christians always cuck it's why we are approaching shithole status. But we'll see; Trump managed to get a lot of these dumb fucks to stop watching football, so maybe he can rile these cucks against Netflix for being ABSOLUTE BIGOTS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST AN ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE (Georgians).

@ArdanianRight Protestant groups heavily supported Reagan in the 1980 election because they thought he would outlaw abortion and make it legal to pray in schools again. After 2-3 years passed and he did neither because Reagan was a neocon establishment whore, protestants decided to form their own political groups and agitate for change. They were highly successful, as shitlibs are still complaining about evil KKKristians like it's the 80s even though SJW faggots control almost all institutions.They need to get off their asses and do it again. And much more vehemently this time.

@nik That can be done at the county level? I thought it was state only.You could literally just drive to another county to buy them in that case. What a pointless law.@orekix @Terry @Ricotta

@nik I've gone there with some Chinamen friends of mine before, got the whole experience. Meet some locals and enjoy the free stuff that comes with it xD@Ricotta

@nik Illinois definitely depends on the area. It's definitely not a shithole, but I'd say parts of the Chicagoland area may fit that description. Its most comparable state is probably Ohio. The average income in Ohio is about 13% less than Illinois, but the cost of living is around 25% less.I'd give the edge to Ohio.@orekix @Ricotta

@Ricotta @nik @orekix People always confuse the priorities of "high income" and "low cost of living." California sure as hell has a high average income, but 100k/yr still won't get you decent living in most of that state.Why do you think so many Google employees - who no doubt make more than the average West Virginia - are living in trailers while the "hillbilly" has a house.

@ChristiJuniorThe reason I mention there are plenty of good women is because you're giving off incel vibes. Let's just say that you're correct about a vast majority of women being unsalvagable pigs, then for what are you fighting? In this scenario there is literal 0 reason to not leave the West and let it burn by it's own excess. There is 0 reason at all to care. You are not bound to your geographical location or even (((Western civilization))) - this is the other side of the sword with which the globalists have been bashing us.I don't question how fucked domestic courts are in much of the developed world, but that's because women haven't yet achieved legal equality, they simply don't have to face the same consequences. Let's help them achieve this equality as I yearn for TRUE SEX equality so that all might suffer.Gynocentrism is not the biggest reason for the decline of the (((West))); we know (((who))) is responsible. Don't take it out on women.Stop defending the (((West))). It's lost. We're no longer traditionalists or conservatives, they lost everything long before we were born, we are reactionaries. Women must be part of any change moving forward. Not these worthless creatures that you're depicting, but real women who are tired of the POZ as well. @chara @1w4kvra

@tootapp But we pan-Africans can still find a home here right?

@ChristiJuniorThink about it like this: if that were true then we've already lost. Unless you plan on producing via gay analsex sporefunk you're not producing a civilization with just men.There are plenty of good women out there. This sex divide into inceldom nonesense is easily the dumbest distraction in the "culture war." @chara

@ChristiJuniorGay if true. Women, provided were not talking some sheeboon, deserve respect; thots and whores don't. Unfortunately it's the latter being (((elevated))) at the expense of the former in pop culture and the youth seem to care about that shit. @chara

@chara ArdanianKike and other are obvious fags, but what's wrong with Raster? Always seemed a pleasant fella to me.

@miya What gay baby jew shit is this?

@matrix Let the musket volleys begin!

@Lanfear Depends on if you got the personality. Regardless that is something that needs to change and will only change if people start doing it: both as a politician and as a voter.I hate to defend the guy, but he did what needs doing: random midwits rising up and saying fuck this system. We need more of that.

@Lanfear I mean, excluding rapefugees where's the lie? It's real easy to not get raped on US college campuses, but women continually do the one thing that will guarantee they find themselves alone with a rapist.

The average person doesn't realize that they have been "groomed" not by a kiddie diddler but by their own governments since circa 2003 in terms of technology and privacy. There is no shortage of people speaking with great confidence about how every word online is public and forever. And yet could you imagine if people said every word spoken in the local tavern was public and forever? No one would tolerate the latter. Why do they tolerate the former? There's nothing keeping the bartender from keeping a diary "log" and using it to manipulate and control people. And yet we wouldn't allow it. So why do we allow them to track our modern-day bar bantz (which happens online) like it's an address to the United Nations General Assembly?

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior I will never cease to be amazed how @matrix normie posting spawns hell threads.

@Ricotta @Agni @orekix Frankly, society is just so used to niggers acting like niggers it isn't considered newsworthy. But when a White person does it it's so shocking it gets national coverage.This has had the unfortunate effect of making the general public feel bad for niggers. This seems to be changing, that's a good thing.Stay triggered and get permanently blocked kike!

@p @levi Yeh, but are you a fag? Like did you even answer his question?

@Ricotta @caseyp @orekix Excluding the fact that they are outnumbered nearly 5:1. Now that's what I call efficiency. At least niggers are good at something.

@caseyp @orekix White on black crime is statistically nonexistant. Niggers are 30x more likely to assault a white person than the other way around.

@orekix It was a -country- music festival. Every single person shot that night voted for Trump.

I'm really tired of people claiming that trannies and faggots are "marginalized" populations that are constantly in danger if they're outed.Nobody is in danger if they're discovered to be a queer. Nobody can be fired for sucking a dick in 2019.You want marginalized? How about being in danger of being fired for posting an unpopular opinion on Facebook or sharing the wrong meme or having the wrong political opinion and just so happening to have white skin at the same time?

@Ricotta @miya They literally aren't suited for anything else, even then as ZOG has proven Europeans are still better at it. That's about all I guess.

Microsoft Word is fucking garbage and fuck all companies for using it.The moment I gain control over IT we're switching to literally any alternative!

There’s nothing wrong with human slavery.RT @times_tribal@twitter.comModern day African Americans wage labourers have it far worse than they ever did during chattel slavery, so many following below the poverty line.

@ChristiJunior @comfy Why he didn't just laugh and call the absurd is the other mystery.

@Ricotta @WIR Well they were doing God's work!

@leyonhjelm In what sense? You see Roe v Wade being overturned? You see deportations of illegals and anchor babies occurring?

@WIR @Ricotta They brought the animals up to dock for walks and had waste collection vents - much like rabit cages.The sailors of the Ark were servants of God and up to the task.

@leyonhjelm Your moralizing failed in an overwhelming majority Christian nation. It failed to prevent mass demographic changes, and it has continued to fail to reverse these changes.It is not my argument that needs revision, it is yours.

@WIR @Ricotta They fished. Fish did fine.

@leyonhjelm That's not an argument.Your argument amounts to moral posturing and holds no salt in the real world. To some the woman breathing justifies an abortion, to others nothing justifies it.Until we move beyond "justification" and look towards the actual effects in reality there will be no actionable solutions.

@augustus @mono He's a cuck by US standards, but rare by UK standards. He's at least pushing conversation forward, even if personally he is a joke.It's why I mock Americans who will only go as far as Carl. They can do so much more here and yet they will still cuck.These people would effectively be a basic Tory in the UK.

@WIR @Ricotta Are you doubting that this was actually built?

@leyonhjelm I don't understand this logic. Even excluding my actual, current beliefs I just see it as flawed.Forcing this child to grow up with a parent who would otherwise abort him will just lead to another abused child and another future crime statistic. Worse yet, the woman may just drink, smoke, or God knows what else to damage the child and aim for miscarriage; and if that fails to succeed give birth to a very defective and disabled child.I see a woman who'd get an abortion as being no true mother, just an abuser in waiting. Forcing a child to live such a life is no mercy in my view, it is senseless punishment.The above argument still holds true in my view, even if it has expanded since.

@leyonhjelm No disagreement on that first half, but why anti-abortion?I'm not going to use that "oh one night mistake argument" on you.

@leyonhjelm I take issue with encouraging people to have children via financial incentives. If we outright bribe idiots who'd otherwise not have children to have children the same issues will arise again once having children is inevitably viewed as "not trendy" or "not profitable." As for abortion, it kind of depends on your stance I guess. You a Con-Abortion no matter what kind of guy?

@roko It has an 80s feel from the images. Those builds, those hair styles!

@leyonhjelm @redwhitebluedude @Lisa22 Though ideally in a sane world that wouldn't even be justification."We need low-skilled workers" also "automation is replacing low skill jobs, learn to code"Seems like less people would have been ideal, but no, let's rush towards a breeding/demographic war.

@PussySlayer Tuscany is a region, not a town or anything. You'd think they'd be more specific and say Lucca or Florence, or really anything more specific.

@roko OK. Another nub question: what show is this?

@leyonhjelm @AtlasFreeman #Blessed #Love

@ChristiJunior @Ricotta It's important to remember that White shitlibs and "color-blind" right wingers are a far bigger threat. The former is obvious, but the latter is key. There is no scenario at which these people magically "wake up." They will continue in perpetuity. Color-blindness is a metric by which they measure their dedication to (((meritocracy))), but also the metric by which they will argue that while Affirmative Action and cronyism are problems any organization that employs them will ultimately fail, despite all evidence to the contrary.

@Ricotta @nepfag @sum Texas. :putin_laugh:

@leyonhjelm My God these people are dumb.

Honestly, I thought that was the whole "separation of church and state" that I keep hearing fags talk about.Regardless, no need to worry if we ban Muslims from entering.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior > All the other groups except Mexicans, who at least are working class, are generally selected to be of above-average intelligence <:trump: They aren't sending their best. :trump: You realize something like 63-67% of "legal" Hispanics are Mexican? Enough of which have a Revanchist attitude of Reconquista.There is no reason to not see deportations of the Reagan amnesty folk and their chain migrants, not the anchor baby and their's as a near term goal after the basic Trump & /Miller/ stuff.After that I could honestly care less if immigration is racially focused, hell I'd probably fight for PURE merit focus (no family members can come at all no matter the circumstances) if it was kept low enough - less than 1% the total over a 10 year time-frame or so. Ideally they would be forced to be absorbed via intermarriage - a sin to some yes, but multi-generational integration is a thing, it is just impossible at current numbers.

@se7en @kaniini 13 year olds aren't adults, they aren't even close to mentally developed.25 is the age at which the brain SHOULD be fully developed.You'd be hard pressed to find a 13 year old equal an 18 or 25 year old; just as you'd find difficulty comparing a 25 year old to a 50 year old.This is advocating that you baby people, but don't expect teens to equal adults. I'm not going to read pedo propaganda, but I understand the issue you stated regarding how modern society keeps attempting to delay adulthood.

@se7en @kaniini Young adult is still adult, so I don't really see an issue with that categorization.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u Then that's where we diverge - likely due to personal circumstance.You really think these El Salvadoran or other various spic chain migrants are not problematic?

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u Then we don't really differ at all before the go from there.My go from there involves deporting past anchor babies and their various chain migrants. Ideally a little more, but that, coupled with the prior, would solve most issues right there.

@jack @ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @ArdanianRight @Lanfear I would never make the mistake of having a cat.

@ChristiJunior @IsaacWestcott @1w4kvra @Lanfear @u why not just be pro-peace, rather than Anti-war? Pretty sure Gandhi said something about that while he was hating him some niggers.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u Ok. The shoot your solution. I think you have a strawman if mine, but I'm used to that so do go on.

@jack @ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @ArdanianRight @Lanfear White people have, do it in a similar manner xD

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u Ok. In what world does an end goal of homogeneity conflict with this? Is this niece begotten of an illegal or anchor baby? If not I don't really see a problem, but it definitely explains why you have a bleeding heart for multiculturalism and (((Diversity))).

@jack @ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear No. I brought that up. His argument has been "multiculturalism is good and part of the US." And "Diversity is our Strength."Please read up and don't jump to conclusions.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u To be clear: I am not personally blaming you, but your mentality.Deporting illegals is a start, but it is not the end. Many "legals" have Revanchist - it's French so I spelled it wrong 100% - attitudes and if allowed to stay will also have that effect as well.

@ArdanianRight Statements like this earn you my :blobheart:

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u Retard is not a creative insult, try again.What I'm saying is: if you were a UK citizen with your equivalent mentality as you have as an American you'd be arguing the logistic difficulty of removing people or the fact that the UK was always diverse so it can work with these people. You'd basically be Carl Benjamin. The only reason you are a little more extreme than him is because you're an American.The damage of mass immigration has already been initiated in the US. Unless you have the resolve to deport all illegals and many "legals" - anchor babies and their chain migrants - you will not solve the underlying issues.You're essentially choosing to allow balkanization to become inevitable rather than fighting it.

@jack @1w4kvra @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @Lanfear People confuse ethnicstates ans ethnostates. That's another issue.

@1w4kvra @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u My problem is that ArdanianKike - you still need to make a good insult for me BTW - would argue that the UK may as well keep it's growing (((Diversity))) because they are: less bland, or because Scots aren't English so they aren't homogenous anyway, or because it'd take effort to correct.There are a million reasons not to do something, but you only need 1 reason to act.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u Japan prides itself on Japanese. I hear it's a shithole.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u You're confusing diversity with (((Diversity))).

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u What is your definition of homogeneous? It was between 84-90% White a majority of it's history. Exclude the South and that number rises to 90-100%.Hell Lincoln wanted to send all slaves back to Africa. Almost, almost.I get it: Diversity is our Strength. :trans: You either believe that or are just telling yourself that it's not bad to cope.End goals don't need be achievable immediately. Just do what is possible to make the end goal achievable. There is no one policy that will achieve this goal. It's piecemeal.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u Is the US more stable and better to live in now than it was before it lost homogeneity? Is multiculturalism and diversity our strength. It's that simple.

@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @Lanfear @undeadmockingbird You seem to be opposing war because people you don't like support it.Support your wars, not theirs.Was the UK stronger or weaker for colonizing? Were the wars to conquer India beneficial? It all depends on the goal and prevailing culture.If to deport and repatriate the nogs one must to go to war and install them within puppet ethnostates so be it.

@ChristiJunior >Leftist will noticeThey already know, they just don't care. They'd definitely go for something that taxes White people to provide a service to Nogs.1950s isn't coming back, nor is it preferable. The back to the kitchen mentality would be less popular than advocating for war with Iran.Just make the goal of your policies to be to hurt your enemies. Government is not a force for good, it never has been. It's a force of violence. Direct the violence towards others.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @undeadmockingbird A gutless, peace loving nation will never fire a nuke. Hell a warmongering ZOG state won't fire a nuke.Wrong. :trump:

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @jack @u Swiss multiculturalism is literally all Europeans. That doesn't excuse or justify any type of nog. You're arguing like those people who cite Nordic countries for socialism and gun control.If you want to make an ethnostate - Japan is more an ethnicstate - you do it in steps. Thinking something impossible is the first step towards doing nothing.Also, you realize that the Midwest is nearly as White as NE despite Cleveland, Chicago, and Detroit existing right? Not to mention there is currently a Black exodus to the South from the Midwest.Why you dropping the NK argument? Bad cherry pick?

@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @Lanfear @undeadmockingbird You don't run on war, you run on liberation. That's your misconception.Never be pro-war in your campaign, only in office. That being said only be anti-war while campaigning if it is expedient to do so.While in office if you show the need to invade these places in a reasonable manner it can be done with little damage.Eliminating war from our culture will not end well. Do you want to become big Tibet?

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @IsaacWestcott @Lanfear @undeadmockingbird I think that your discussion is pointless because one can't be "pro-war" or "anti-war". One needs to judge from circumstances.For example I am against the Russian military intervention in Syria because is a waste of money (I am anti-war) and yet in regards to Ukraine I am very pro-war (I think that Putin has abandoned the ethnic Russians of the Donbass and has been soft on our enemies).As for nation building, you need to reclaim the word for neocons. I am for example in favour of nation building, in favour of building a Russian national state although my ideas of nation building will probably appear awful to most neocons (even thought I do at least on paper believe in democracy as they do, but not of the liberal kind)

@ChristiJunior My idea was to keep it legal, tax it at 1000% and waive the tax for "historical minorities." Offer free sterilization - but call it something else - after a 2nd abortion.So basically WHITES subsidize NOG abortions. The tax will be too much for most Whites, so they just won't do it most of the time.In the short term, I'll take strict abortion laws in majority White states.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @u If we're cherry picking explain Japan. While you're at it name a stable multicultural society.Furthermore, if we are adding infinite nuance: maybe it's because 99%+ of the world is in economic warfare with North Korea. Also, maybe it's because their economic system sucks.@jack likes NK talks, I'm sure he's got something.

@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @Lanfear @undeadmockingbird >Bring tranny rights and gay rights to the unfortunate country in questionThis is a problem why? Seems to me this has the intended effect of lowering their fertility.The current powers that be aren't going to do anything beneficial. But the MIC wants only one 1 thing: to sell weapons and thus go to war. They are the easiest power player to predict and probably the least ideological - aside from the Jews involved, which oddly isn't too high a number.> TL;DR American Neocolonialism sucksThat's because it's not nationalistic, it's currently multicultural and globalist. That leads to the same answer: nothing will change with the prevailing culture and powers that be.Defending the nuances of (((multiculturalism))) and random based negros like some people do will not let rhetoric change in any meaningful way.

@ChristiJunior I'm not a "pro-lifer" if you read my post on this BTW. I kind of think you think I'm towing tbe cuckservative line on this issue.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @u There is no rhetoric in which this doesn't devolve to "Diversity is our Strength."

@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @Lanfear @undeadmockingbird Let me throw a hypothetical war here: El Salvador.We currently have roughly 1/5 of those shitholers here, most rapefugees. Why not use this as a CB to depose their leaders and install the most popular from among their US community as puppet leaders -  with a single goal in mind: stabalize fertility rates (read lower) and we keep you fat and happy? We can even form repatriation programs. It's not like they can't be of some use tp us while there either. I don't know a lot of El Salvadors economics, but I assume there is something that they can produce that would be useful to us as long as they continue to exist.Do this for X Latin American country.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @u I'd also like to point out: Anglo humor is far superior. The allies were reportedly very disturbed by the Anglo/American trench humor in WW1 - evidently it was quite macabre.

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @u So you're arguing for multiculturalism? You realize that is incompatible with homogeneity and as such incapable of forming a coherent argument against demographic changes.

@p I'll name my first son Magnus and my second Chad. The first is badass, but with a younger brother with a name like Chad he'll have to work extra hard to maintain his edge!

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @u The food argument. Every. Single. Time.Buy a cookbook, import ingredients. You don't needs Turks to make kebab.How would the culture be blander? Is cRAP the only music that is capable of being exciting?

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @u You realize that technology exists, right? You Black Supremacist!

@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @Lanfear @undeadmockingbird You know my views on abortion - I posted my ideal earlier. So it's not about supporting the "beautiful whatevers."Obama ran anti-war, but he wasn't anti-War. If anything we should encourage low income - read spics - GenZ and younger millenials to join the military and go die in pointless wars. I hear Ethiopia has done... something... probably as good a reason as any to send them to die.You stand nothing to gain by actually being anti-War in the US. If you're plan is to work within the political channels, you got to cede something to the establishment - war is the best way to get funding for your campaign and send nogs to kill nogs abroad.

@1w4kvra @Lanfear @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @u It's not a bad idea. Providing free 3DS to the males would be good too.

@p To be clear I don't know the context of this. I liked because of the "banging ladies by the bushel."

@ArdanianRight @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @u With smaller numbers comes the possibility for assimilation. I don't see any value in a non homogeneous population, and I don't see the world never needing to unite under a single polity. That alone should make the conclusion obvious that ideally their fertility must approach 0.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @Lanfear @u There is literally no reason that the end goal shouldn't be sterilization. But realistically right now the more pressing issue is on our lack of fertility.The best way to drop theirs and simultaneously increase ours would be dropping foreign aid and taxes.

@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @Lanfear @u Literally none of this follows. Seeming less bloodthirsty is pointless, because clearly no one gives a fuck anyway. Opposing wars just makes the status quo hate us for another reason. Even the War in Iraq did not change the 13:50 crime rate, it didn't make the economy irrelevant, people are capable of noticing multiple things at once. You can approach more than one idea at a time. You may as well just take OP argument to mean "Ignore abortions! It distracts from the immigration issue!" If you are only capable of autistically focus on a handful of issues you will lose 100%.

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @u Don't pay people to have kids. Just pay the right people to not have kids. That's the current tenable approach.

@Lanfear @ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @augustus @u I hate this anti-war stance. Refugees don't matter if you don't let them in. Seriously just militarize and block the border.The only reason rapefugees are a problem is because they are blindly let in.

@1iceloops123 @augustus @shpuld I'm reporting this to TPUSA!

@1w4kvra @Lanfear @ChristiJunior @augustus @u Good luck on that. That's like step 3000 and we're around step 4.

@ChristiJunior @u @1w4kvra @augustus Any solution realistically needs to be based around how to prevent ours from aborting and either encouraging or not impeding others.Free sterilization with your 2nd abortion? 1000% tax on all abortions, but waived for "historic minorities" and shit like that.

@1iceloops123 @augustus @shpuld Wow, don't mock Candice Owens like that! I can bc she's my mam!

@1iceloops123 @augustus @shpuld There is just no imagine in which she doesn't look disgusting.

@1w4kvra @augustus Anything that pushes rightward is generally good. I just wish Ohio had gotten that exception for blacks to still get abortions. That's what a proper abortion law looks like.

@augustus you wouldn't be able to say that if u were aborted ;)))

@judgedread @WIR I tried wearing a hat recently, was told it aged me about 20 years. Guess that's off the table.

@a7 @Jdogg247 @forte @rasterman @slickpockets That wouldn't have been a problem if the elites were not (((infiltrated))). Honestly, the commonman is retarded, why give him power? Universal Suffrage opened the doors for Jews and other undesirables, but getting rid of it now does nothing better because it leaves said (((elite))) in power.Vote with your feet: move out of the West. That's the only vote worth shit anymore.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight I don't know enough about how the fediverse works, but I assume someone could write a 3rd party program capable of searching the fediverse.

@a7 @Jdogg247 @forte @rasterman @slickpockets That's for a singular election and we all see how effective that has been.The problem is there is no real solution to our current government. Right now you got the hostile replacement population and cucks for the popular vote, and if you switch it to elites well those levels have already been (((compromised))).There is no fixing this system legally barring positive demographic changes.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight Well fuck those fags, search function good.

@a7 @forte @Jdogg247 @rasterman @slickpockets Shame we let the poors, illegals, eyc vote. It seems to me universal suffrage made things worse.

@rasterman @forte @Jdogg247 @slickpockets What kind of retards even thought "interpretation" was a good idea? Just write the laws in normal, understandable language. Like only an absolute faggot thinks it's a good idea to require years of specialized training to understand the law. All lawyers must be killed - THAT'S THE REAL FINAL SOLUTION!

@Secftblgirl:putin_wink:

@Secftblgirl @Jdogg247 @se7en What do you think the subject is exactly, sweeties? I only ask since evidently we're in elementary reading comprehension now.

@Secftblgirl @Jdogg247 @se7en Politicization is not a sufficient reason. The real question: why not just build it anyway?

@WIR Hell you can get a button down and some cheap khakis for like 25$ at Walmart.

@se7en @Jdogg247 Can the courts literally just block everything? Like why have a president, just have the high arbiters decide our fate. I've never seen courts block so much shit before, let alone random pleb judges blocking executive actions.Not that I'm advocating for violence or anything, just saying the people responsible for this have names and places of residence. I'm certain you could toss a milkshake at them real easily.

@Jdogg247These people keep blocking legal action on no grounds. Where are these documents the no-name judges are submitting to prevent this? The earliest blocks were claiming travel bans against nations of terror were illegal despite Article 8 of US Code permits him to do so. What did those documents say? What do the documents for this one say? On what grounds to they keep doing this, successfully?

@judgedread @PussySlayer Nobody really likes Jews, it's just until recently everybody was suppressed enough to ignore them. Honestly, do you really know anyone who cares about the holohoax? The worst I hear is "Oh how sad, 6 million died." It's not insightful, it's not caring, and it's certainly hardly genuine. It's just empty, trained and meaningless displays of empathy.

@Jdogg247 2 years, barely any coverage.

Notice how we didn’t see much about this when it happened:386494B9-3B06-43CD-9EE0-2502D01…

@nyvoter The holocaust never happened, but it should have, and I hope another one happens real soon!

Some fucking luck they'll have come 2100 when the various caliphates start looking for loot.Here's an interesting site BTW: https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2050/

@judgedread @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior They are falling more rapidly than the US. Western Europe under age 5 is 22-40% muds - pending country. Unless they get to deporting they are fucked.I don't see anyone in Europe save Orban - and he's Hungarian so wgaf - proposing anything other than half measures AND LOSING!Until they start having more kids and deporting the current numbers are irrelevant. We can't just look at present and say it will be fine, that's what happened in the Americas! We need to consider the future.

@ChristiJunior @Lanfear @ArdanianRight @judgedread @rasterman TBH, the status quo will not begin to change until Whites have a growing birthrate. We are a dying demographic so no existing structures will support us ever. The number of us in important positions will continue to decrease and we will be replaced. It's likely too late to stop.Hence my idea: just fucking leave the West and let it rot. The good of us should relocate elsewhere. Then we'll claim our sacred CB in 2800 years and talk about how the Anglo-Saxon, our distant ancestors, once shit on the streets of Londistan and we demand it returned!

@judgedread @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @Lanfear @rasterman What if we just genocide the inhabitants when we invade?I never understood this whole: Muslims are people too line of thought.

@ChristiJunior @Lanfear @ArdanianRight @judgedread @rasterman It's perfectly realistic and understandable to support Israel, comrade!I mean can't they have just one country? What do you mean the West is White? That's nonesense it's for everyone, race is a myth! What do you mean Europe is Christian? Why can't the Muslims come in are you an Islamaphobe?

@Lanfear @ArdanianRight @IsaacWestcott @judgedread @rasterman I'm genuinely disgusted by just how passionate he is about Israeli territorial expansion and everything Jewish.I bet you'll never see him this passionate about preserving the West's white majority, or about taking back Constantinople.

@Lanfear @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @judgedread @rasterman Well he doesn't much care to enforce the border either.

@ChristiJunior @Lanfear @ArdanianRight @judgedread @rasterman Of course he does, he's pro mass immigration.

@Lanfear @rasterman @ArdanianRight @judgedread Holy Shit. Can you imagine saying Europeans have land rights? Especially 2800 year old claims.Sounds like Italy has a claim to all of Europe.

@ArdanianRight @Lanfear @judgedread @rasterman He's just the world's biggest cuck. He's a neocon, a globohomo, anti-racist, and corporatist mouthpiece all in one turd sandwich.

@rasterman @TrevorGoodchild @ArdanianRight @Lanfear Crowder has been bashing the neocons lately too. I'm not certain how much longer he and Little Ben are going to remain friends, he's said some overtly anti-Israel things and is still in contact with Owen Benjamin.

@TrevorGoodchild @rasterman @ArdanianRight @Lanfear He was still able to defeat the communist water buffalo! As dumb as he is he's still got the edge over American shitlibs.

@rasterman @ArdanianRight @Lanfear That man was quite the experienced goy. He even gave him the old arrogant British laugh!

@Lanfear @ArdanianRight I was hoping that little rat would try to primary Trump. Even if Trump isn't "anti-Semitic" you know he'd make some comments about little yarmulke boy wanting to send Americans to die for Israel, his Jewish brethren.

@ArdanianRight @Lanfear >ShekelsteinWe should just call all grifters this TBH. Can you imagine PJW or JBP crying about how anti-semitic these attacks are and "acktually i'm not even a Jew!"It'd be curious to see what conspiracies Alex Jones comes up with too "These DEMONS are trying to get us to go to war with Israel so Revelations can occur. :alexjonesyelling: "

@amerika The promise of America is that you will lose your nation? That's the shittiest promise that I've ever heard.[I see that author was a member of our favourite tribe of course]But modern day - since you're about politics - assuming we barely deport the "12" million illegals and get maybe that many more to repatriate as a result we're still looking at #le56 in 2050.Would you be opposed to attracting immigrants from Europe at large - assuming it was also merit focused, so most would be NW anyway - as a means to combat #le56 from getting worse?This piece seems to bank on the idea that collapse is inevitable. I don't think that's a safe assumption.

@chara @amerika So essentially: no man, no problem.

@a7 @ChristiJunior @amerika No he didn't. Rates like that weren't seen until the late 50s, but he certainly did set us on that course - one of his greatest failings.Prior to him income tax was heresy - as it should be - can you imagine a world where you didn't pay for the propagation of dysgenic niggers? There would be no SS, no Medicare or Medicaid, no MIC, no food stamps, etc.If you want to as a short term attack against the (((oligarchs))) temporarily raise the top marginal tax rate to 90% and fuck these monopolistic corps I'll support it. But it would have never reached this point had we not decided the state needs to manage your income anyway.

@ChristiJunior @a7 @amerikan  That's not a leftist stance, that's just anti-monopolistic. The only president to ever do shit about monopolies was Teddy, who incidentally, was right-wing.Liberals are leftist no matter what "but it's not real leftism" fags will say.Not wanting to outsource the rights of private citizens isn't a left-right issue; it's an intersectional jew-goy issue.

@ChristiJunior @a7 @amerika I'm not. Fuck welfare and that shit. We're not going to produce a more eugenic society by propping up every single low life. Leftist economic policies run counter to natural selection, no matter what NatSoc like to claim. What is a single good leftist economic stance in $current_year? Seriously, I'm curious.

@LanfearDon't be jealous.@Jdogg247

@ArdanianRight "...not giving a fuck about optics..." Possible something to consider?

@chara I keep mistyping or using the wrong tense lately. I'll just leave out "if or when" or use the wrong word entirely.Since I'm currently living in Sunrise land I thought I'd give a throwback to this old song because of the "I'm turning Japanese" line - even though that's referencing something else.

@ArdanianRight @Ricotta Over 90% of children of any demographic will choose CoD without good parental direction or proper incentives. There's more to it. But in regards to as you put it the "idiocracy" factor, what are the causes? That's what we would need to answer.

@Ricotta @ArdanianRight You'd be surprised the ability of our education system to kill all the wonder and creativity in a child. Intelligence is very epigenetic. You need the potential, but you also need to tools to develop. Give one kid a library and the other CoD and see which one flourishes.

@Zilya @judgedread You're brutal online? You're like the Mr Rogers of FSE. But since you just admitted mean words make you physically ill this makes sense.Did you know that Western civilization is brown and Jewish? As such it really can decline anymore.

@ArdanianRight Well it can't be immigrants, they are outright better than us. That's what all the media outlets and politicians have been saying anyway. In all seriousness, participation trophy culture, increased TV and video game consumption, as well as "No Child Left Behind" type policies are probably contributing to the internal decreases.

@ArdanianRight I wonder if anything has changed in these nations. It'd be really interesting if there was someway to see what regions or perhaps groups were "dropping."

@a7 Sounds about like every tranny that has come to accept reality. Hopefully you find something to be happy.Kids who talk like that "i dunno if I'm x" are either absolute faggots who want attention for their latest analsex cam or someone who is so dumb they are just waiting to be a suicide statistic.

@ArdanianRight How do you make that judgement? Do you have experience with hormone imbalances personally? Have you experience with trannies IRL? Do you have even the slightest idea the mindset of dumb kids scared enough to go on the internet to seek advice because "sanctioned and professional sources" are telling them to nuke their bodies? Most of these people are going to make mistakes, nearly 50% will attempt suicide, some smaller number of them will succeed. No amount of postulating on common sense will alter this reality.I don't pity the tranny, but I have personally had the misfortune of dealing with these people IRL enough to somewhat understand them - and that's with years of exposure. Their minds are generally a mess and you walk away a little more misanthropic and angry at every interaction. Anyone who advises these people chemically castrate themselves and fuck up their entire endocrine system should be killed without exception.

@a7 Well. I'm glad that you're, better?

@a7 A fine shitpost with as much a foundation in reality as tranies themselves.The fact that these people have to seek advise online is a sign our society has failed.

@a7 Keep triggering the libs!

These recent trends of spergs trying to play psychologist by giving young trannies advise if funny. Like any of you have any experience, like any of you have done any real study. You're just as blind and foolish as the tranny, stop trying to sound smart as you spew useless rhetoric.

@ArdanianRight The Jews are smart enough to realize that lolspergertarians are dumb enough to kill themselves without help. You're like the trannies of the right-wing.@ChristiJunior

@judgedreadDo we want everyone to be happy? Say we win the culture war, all this shit turns on them. Don't you want to return everything tenfold? Allowing them to live peacefully is tantamount to live and let live. Fuck that mentality, it's what let them gain power in the first place.

make a twitter dot com account where you say nigger and send swastikas to commie kike accounts. get retweeted by commie kike accounts for saying nigger and posting swastikas. print out physical swastikas and anonymously mail them to your local commie kike. call your local congresspersons and remind them about the 14 words. photobomb your local news broadcast to say nigger and heil hitler. start a local white-nationalist book club. start a local white-nationalist charity.

@meowski @ArdanianRight @Secftblgirl Not just them, but other sources show women - excluding asian - are more loyal to their own race than men.Women are also on average OK with dating a "racist" more often than men. There are other nuances, so it's not like men are blameless in all of this. No worthwhile woman wants a pussy liberal, even SJWs tend to respect a more aggressive male than a beta - regardless what she crytypes in her next Vox oped.

@jack @HoldenCaulfield Slightly related: we need more public baths. I enjoy onsens and the like and find normal baths too boring because I have no one to talk to. The public baths fix this issue.Besides if we had more public nudity we could settle some popular urban myths regarding certain sexual organs xD

@Terry We have room for Whites in the US. If people are coming regardless - which is probably going to be the global paradigm  until at least 2070 - we might as well focus young, educated Europeans disillusioned by the overly Egalitarian EU society. Alternatively you could aim for my current path and take up residence in rural East Asia. It's not a bad place to start an expat enclave and I could see many enjoying the lifestyle.@Lanfear @chara

@ChristiJunior @Ricotta @rasterman Yeh, just call them faggots. Winning against this hostile media entails ignoring what it tells you or how it judges you. Just correct people whenever they say Chelsea Jenner and say "Bruce Jenner." That's what I do and it ends one of 2 ways: they concede in order to finish their point or they get triggered, call me a bigot and leave. Either way the legitimacy of their worldview was brought to question.

@prydt 100% Correct. You have to hone your personality. It takes dedication and may even earn you scorn, but it is well worth the effort!

#TipOfTheDayDo not collaborate with the "center-right," as they will no collaborate with you. Do not defend the lolbertarian, as they will not defend you.Do not support the classical liberal, as they will not support you.If these factions want everyone to remain atomized, want eveyone to seek a pat on the head from the MSM, and seek compromise with the commies over the "fringe right" then let them fail.#Lolspergertarians #Cucks #Cuckservatives #TheWestIsBrownAndJewish

@tuxcrafting @succucirno @perkele I don't think he got the joke.

@u @Lanfear Just leave. I've said it before and I'll say it again: no sane White person should stay in the West.Let the kikes, spergs, nogs, trannies, lolbertarianspergs, cucks and classical liberals die. They want to lose? Let them. The West is dead.

@succucirno @perkele @tuxcrafting Chinaman identified!

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Again why seek leftist approval? The msm will bash them for you.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Piecemeal. Immigration reform into deportations, reproductive incentives, even using diaspora populations here for imperialistic purposes could be possible (ex we have 1/5 of el salvador population here). Remember -30% in 40 years. There's no reason it cannot go the other way in another 40 years. But you have to win on the issues and push the culture in that direction. Nothing will change if you just think it impossible and refuse to act.This is a review of a WN roadmap to reverse trends (not 30% reversal - but again consider the reviewer and his idea that culture is stagnant) by a CivNat. It's fairly reasonable, but there's a bias. I'm not endorsing this plan as full proof, but it is food for thought.The writer of the article actually reminds me of you.https://medium.com/migration-issues/what-it-would-take-to-keep-america-white-fe441e7e8ffd

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior I don't even have an argument because you've thoroughly confused me.I just don't understand why you're opposed to demographic changes if you don't seek to reverse them. You seem almost like a mainline conservative bot from the 80s that missed a couple patches.

@jack What effect has it had?

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior I refer to the "who gives a fuck" argument. The media will never be your friend. They will not shower you with love, they will smear you. But if you think you're going to half measure this you're sorely mistaken. Best case outcome of what I perceive your methods to create is turning white identity into (((white identity))).

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @noyoushutthefuckupdad Now whose applying arguments to people. I didn't realize WN entailed a desire to removing all non-Whites, not that it would bother me.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @noyoushutthefuckupdad He does sound a bit how I used to think, but not calling out leftist approval seeking especially when it entails entertaining their stupid strawmen as legit doesn't sit well with me.If you've realized demographics matter you have 2 options: reverse or integrate. We're not integrating these numbers and something tells me the white knight doesn't want to marry a Mestizo.

@ArdanianRight @noyoushutthefuckupdad @ChristiJunior Keep it up and the old blue hair may even let you feed her cats.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @noyoushutthefuckupdad The guy is kiked. His idea of a solution would trade immigration reform for an amnesty.He's not a WN, he's just a boy afraid of change that doesn't want to be called racist.Honestly, he should just move to Texas. He has the "right" cucked attitude and can learn how to live around Hispanics. This is a valuable experience for one who essentially supports the status quo.

@jack Personally I dont dislike him. But he failed at getting blacks off the plantation. Kind if his whole goal.

@ArdanianRight @moonman @noyoushutthefuckupdad Then you should be less concerned with demographic changes and more concerned with integration. It suits your kosher "marry the Jews" attitude.It makes sense, considering you equate WN with Nazism. It also explains why your arguments are so weak and you constantly seek pats on the head from leftists.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @moonman @noyoushutthefuckupdad I'm untagging the blue hair.Wrong. It's because he had something to lose that he needed to say it. A rando saying these things is not as important as a sitting politician saying them. Voting for immigrantion restriction? Because that's going to happen in a Blue house? No. Steve King helped a lot even by being condemned. He showed us many of the snakes on the Right. Everyone who condemned him is an enemy. They are people who will always cuck and will never be on /our side/.

@IsaacWestcott @ArdanianRight @JulieSqveakaroo @moonman @noyoushutthefuckupdad There are a few reasons why the Left always want us to play the Denouncement Game (I remember this well from #GamerGate):1) To keep anti-leftist forces divided, always punching people even slightly to their right. You see this in Britain - Nigel Farage will condemn Tommy Robinson, Robinson will condemn "racists" etc.2) To keep the public conversation focused on "bad actors" on our side, rather than how crazy and evil the Left is.3) To associate us with the worst people on our side - one of the reasons the denouncement game doesn't work is that they amount to Suspiciously Specific Denials, associating us with the Villain Of The Week even as we're condemning them. Like with #GamerGate - if GamerGate people keep talking about online harassment, even to condemn it, GamerGate inevitably becomes associated with online harassment in the eyes of Normies.

@noyoushutthefuckupdad @ArdanianRight @moonman They don't have to be your friend. But you don't have to be the one to bludgeon them either. Until recently the Left understood this and used it to great effect.I don't consider ArdanianKike to be my friend even though he purports to be a WN.

@ArdanianRight @JulieSqveakaroo @moonman @noyoushutthefuckupdad Saying anything right of center is "dumb" if you are looling for validation from the media (aka the enemy of the people).Steve "Make Your Own Babies" King said what we needed saying. Do you really think there are going to be any deportations or right-ward change without being as explicit as the Left?No matter how kosher you are you will be called a Nazi by the media. Stop playing by their rules and stop giving validity to their point of view.

@jack I just don't see those people as useful. How long has Farrakhan been failing now? I admire him for going socialist to try to get his fellow nogs hooked with the gibs train, but there is no waking up for a vast majority of nogs.

@ArdanianRight @moonman @noyoushutthefuckupdad I bet this literal blue haired, open borders, probable obese cat lady would be willing to go out for milkshakes after seeing you condemn this hypothetical "Nazi" which is far more scary than any possible Marxist.

@ArdanianRight @noyoushutthefuckupdad @JulieSqveakaroo @moonman There are literal communists in the US Congress in the Democrat party. Last I checked no one was condemning them.Difference? They actually made it into office, meanwhile kosher, borderline ethnats like Steve King gets kneecapped by his own party.

@ArdanianRight @noyoushutthefuckupdad @moonman Agreed and amplified comrade. We need to change our optics to appeal to the literal open borders blue hair! If we apologize for all the "bad" white nationalists they'll listen the "good" ones like us. This is in no way the same thing mainline cuckservatives do to us.

@jack In what world are we living?

@JulieSqveakaroo If we want to expand this to the most autistic extent possible - which considering how you worded this you do - being born black, hindi, white, jewish, or whatever is a choice.Your parents chose to procreate fully knowing the result would be a child of X race. They could have chosen to just be citizens of the world and live child-free and traveled, but they did us all a dis-service and gave birth to you.

@WIR @judgedread @rasterman I think it's focused on increasing miscegenation. Have you heard how some of these people talk about intermarriages? Like if you marry a German as a Swiss you're going to have webbed eyes of something.

@judgedread @rasterman The South also has a ton of blacks, I'd not be surprised to see that contribute. Of course I'd also not be surprised if they just never got married in the first place.

@blarkin58 HELL YEAH BROTHER! ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!

@Kro @Jdogg247 @p @PussySlayer Alex Jones really needs to be given control of a video game creativity team. Any game that he is involved in developing will be amazing. The man is absolutely legendary.

@matrix @Ricotta There are multiple problems with giving kids hormones opposite their sex. The least of which being most of them grow out of it during puberty - in otherwords that biological process tends to correct the issue most of the time. Most medical experts do not advise hormone treatment for pre-pubertal gender-dysphoria not only because of this, but because of potential long term developmental damage. There are also many diseases that FtM Trans take testosterone, the least of which is not huge increases in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. MtF Trans have huge increases in the risks of various cancers. It's all around not a healthy decision to imbalance your hormones and the best solutions long term would involve prenatal screenings and methods to correct the development of these issues prior to birth and techniques that do not involve further in-balancing your endocrine system.@nik

@p @judgedread @onewaydotcom I've said it before McCarthy is a saint and a hero! His only mistake was not naming the Jew!Kent State is a farce because of the injured victims were Jews (I shit you not look it up)! Based Ohio wins again!image.pngimage.png

@yogthos @jasonoliveira Can people opt out of your system? I highly doubt it so I fail how to see "pooling other people's resources" is a moral high ground.Any system that can decide to take all your stuff because enough people said it was good is deplorable.

@PussySlayer Of course you dig whites. You're no dirty misceginator xD

@rasterman @ChristiJunior @Ricotta You could like instead. Appreciate my wisdom.

@ArdanianRight @rasterman Consider: how a character fares according to the meta also effects perceived usefulness and thus tier placement.Bayonetta for insance does well against FE characters. So let's say tournaments become dominated by characters like Lucina, Marth, Snake, Link, and toss in Chrom (just bc FE). Bayonetta will fare VERY well against all these characters despite her being mid tier and them all high tier. Enough Bayonetta players could shift her up and shift the meta to the point some of the others fall.Also: Marth is objectively better than Lucina, people are too lazy to learn to use - JUST THE TIP!@ChristiJunior @forte

@rasterman @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @forte Difference being that tier lists can change rapidly due to the actions of a few good players. Niggers being niggers is eternal.Example: Marth is theoretically better than Lucina, but is lower on the tier list because of skill cap. But theoretically a perfect Marth would destroy a perfect Lucina.

@roko @Ricotta That's just internalized White Supremacy.

@djsumdogDo philosophy degree holders live anywhere else?

@Alby13% = 50%All black women who give birth to sons are literally murderers, but abortion is also murder.Thus all black women are murderers.

@Ricotta That's a pretty slick analogy.

@ChristiJunior @rasterman @ArdanianRight @forte Tier lists are hellah dumb. Someone doing well with a character just makes everyone think that character is good.Yeah Wolf has got a blaster, but can he take the full wrath of the lemon blade?

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @forte @rasterman I don't see a single Robin.Do these faggots even know how to play the game?

@Ricotta @ChristiJunior @nik @pagefault I think it's more than that. It's not like trans doesn't have a basis in reality at least mentally.If we focused more on actually helping the few actual trannies out there instead of grievance politicking you'd probably see less suicides and less creatures like this:Tusky_1558313121930_CB7JG6INRN.…

@ChristiJunior @Ricotta @nik @pagefault That is really annoying. As long as they keep up the charade that trans are whatever they say they are why can't they compete in whatever sport they want? So many shitlibs around me jump to defend every rando "minority" or whatever, but then take issue on MTF trans being in female sports? So what biology instantly matters now? No, fuck that I'll defend trans sports just to spite them and call them a bigot if they disagree.

@rawrrawrfox @Ricotta I literally put "Black" on every job application and have for a few years now, no one has questioned me. I'll be choosing black on the 2020 census as well.If they say race is a social construct then I want me some affirmative action, putting "White" has worked against me in the past so fuck them.

@Kiiro Fair terms and conditions with a recent precedent.

@Kiiro CONTEXT DOESN'T MATTER! SALTINES BELONG TO US! NEVER MENTION THEM IN CONVERSATION!

@ChristiJunior Of all people to be the New Right king maker it had to be Trump.We get the leaders we deserve.

@ChristiJunior I've heard of a Mark Collet and the old BNP or is it now the Britain First? Is he just a strategist, youtuber, blogger, what's his deal?

@ChristiJunior I disagree with the guy a lot and think a lot of shit he's done is counterproductive. But I still don't celebrate his downfall. He represented something good: he was a normal guy - literally 105 IQ man - who got fed up and took action into his own hands. His winning could have been inspirational in that regard. People would think "If that fat slob can make it so can I." This whole thing could disillision a lot of people at a time when people need to be energized.

@Prodigal @TrevorGoodchild Just a cohencidence goy. Cool it with the anti-Semitism.

@amerika In terms of your critique on the media interesting there is no disagreement. But what regulations would you impose that would help?The biggest issue appears to be monopolies and how to deal with those. Aside from that I think front page redactions need to be enforced. Whenever a fake hate crime occurs, or a false rape accusation, it gets front page news for weeks. Everyone is saturated in it, everyone knows it. Then if it's proven to be verifiably false you'd be lucky to find a side page redaction. These things should be required to both be backed by evidence when reported on and redactions issued FRONT PAGE when proven false - ideally naming the real perpetrators (whether that be the actor's brother or the shifty rabbi).Any regulation needs to be smart and leave as little room as possible for exploitation. Even making it easier to sue media companies who defamed an individual or group without evidence in an article should be fair game. Break these giants up and hit their pocket books and the SJW clickbate shit is gone.

@judgedread @p @u If he comes out unscathed after they'll just dig for an instance in which he used a mean race word. You cannot appease these people. Just call them fags and leave it at that.

@judgedread @p @u Well has he considered telling them to fuck off? Like what are they going to do, cut funding? Will people stop using linux?Just pull an old :trump: he's proven that it's possible to double down and win!

@judgedread @p @u I completely missed this, how did Torvalds invoke the (((PC))) ire?

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight The whole thing is very Talmudic. While it is entirely possible to both be an individual and realize that you have a shared group interest, this does not mean that you take all negatives of both and none of the positives or vice-versa.This same line of thinking can easily be applied to Diversity. I recall during my education when we discussed Africa one of the reasons we were told the various nation states failed was because they were divided without consideration of differing ethnic groups and thus created an unstable, diverse population with conflicting interests. Then towards the end of my college years I started to hear things like: "Diversity if our Strength!"

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight But we're all individuals still, despite group oppression or something.

@PussySlayer @Oblivia @WIR I SPELL LIKE A FUCKING IDJUT!

@PussySlayer @Oblivia @WIR Things change because public will changes. Leaders enact whatever the prevailing culture dictates.Our ability to survive and remain free relies solely on our ability to make touch decisions and approach difficult topics in the open.

@PussySlayer @p @ArdanianRight @djsumdog Boomer Confirmed.

Smuglo houses a ton of absolute faggots. I'm grateful that @nepfag is gathering them all in one place for us to gas.

@PussySlayer I honestly think these issues are exacerbated under democratic systems, but that's a whole different argument entirely.Also, I am now facist confirmed. @p is going to gave to put me to digital pasture now.@ArdanianRight @djsumdog

@PussySlayer @ArdanianRight @djsumdog @p Maybe. But I think we need to start recognizing society as comprised of groups not just individuals.I'm pro-individual freedom, but ultimately a society is only as good as its components. At the micro level that is the individual, but 1 level up are the groups to which these individuals belong.Certainly there are fine black individuals, but name me a single majority black community that isn't a shithole. Why for instance are Baltimore and Detroit not like Seattle or Portland - to be clear I still dislike Portland, but for different reasons?I think you can have small numbers of those people present and still have a healthy, functioning society (we have a fine example of one such individual on here from GAB), but as time progresses and more and more example enviroments become available to analyze the same pattern emerges.

@PussySlayer @ArdanianRight @djsumdog @p Ok? I don't disagree, but my point remains valid.

@p @PussySlayer @ArdanianRight @djsumdog I'm not convinced that you're not going to prison someday.

@p Discrimination is good.

@PussySlayer @ArdanianRight @djsumdog @p I've had #NAXALT used far too many times. I'm sticking with #YAXALT.Sure there are definitely good nogs out there, but at the end of the day the only really good ones are the ones that don't leave their shitholes.The point remains: 13:50. I think that the same people who #NAXALT here would #NAXALT if it were 13:70, 10:50, 13:90, 14:100. Because of this the nuance is pointless, as nuance always exists in theory. But this line of thinking prevents action.

@p @ArdanianRight @PussySlayer @se7en I believe the 2nd ammendment should cover: tanks, nukes, jets, artillery, helicopters or anything you want as originally intended. We should be training kids how to shoot and gun safety, not stop drop and roll in the presence of a gun. I'll concede that the increasingly nogged population makes this idea currently bad. So first that needs be attended.

@PussySlayer @ArdanianRight @djsumdog @p Maybe exposure to real niggers changes their views? I already know niggers are bad, so I don't need this lesson. I'll take my guns, low taxes, and friendly local shopkeeps over Starbucks and McDs. I realize that considering I currently live in literally the largest metro area in the world makes this ironic, but you can just right off.

@ArdanianRight @se7en @PussySlayer @p It can't be more dysgenic than liberal democracy. Liberal democracy has proven to be disastrous to the gene pool.

@PussySlayer @p @ArdanianRight @djsumdog I like small town America. I don't run into urbanite soy creatures on the daily and I don't have to listen to CNN while in public.

@PussySlayer @se7en @ArdanianRight @p It doesn't take much to look more sane and preferable to ZOG world. That doesn't make either of those ideologies ideal.I do want a primarily White state (one may even call it an ethnostate), but I don't want a White welfare state. I don't honestly know enough about fascism or NatSoc to judge if they are inherently "freedom infringy" or not, but I can see how they are preferable to (((Democratic Socialism))).

@djsumdog @p @PussySlayer @ArdanianRight I once called a nigger the gamer word and he immediately dropped dead. The mean race words were too much for his McDs clogged heart!

@p @PussySlayer @ArdanianRight The whole "being exposed to fascist ideas instantly turns the listener into a fascist and thus fascist ideas must be censored to preserve freedom argument."

@PussySlayer @pDid this, presumable faggot, threaten to tax you or call you a bigot?

@ArdanianRight @Jdogg247 Right wing outlets mostly don't need to do so, the MSM does that enough.Coulter and Tucker are among the few who constructively criticize Trump.

@rasterman @matrix Wants to be treated equal to man. "Becomes" man. Is treated as man. Wants to be treated as woman.

@jack What would have brought it full circle was if the sash said nigger.

@Jdogg247 Answer: They invite communists and pestilence into their communities and wonder why things become worse.

@WIR @Ricotta @jack I don't think you understand what I said. Possessing something means you stand to lose it. But he has so much he cannot lose it.

​image.png

@jack I was going to use that example. Trump has both power and fearlessness. He has so much to lose and has experience loss and as such he has nothing to lose.Hopefully we get more Trumps, he is not perfect, but his attitude s something we need.Conversely, someone like Carl has so little to lose that he can easily lose everything. That is a mental block that someone like him cannot defeat. He is neither strong nor fearless, so he shouldn't have acted as such.TL;DR: Trump is a leader, Carl is not. Fearlessness is for the strong.

@jack @ChristiJunior It's perfectly acceptable to disregard the media and whatever they say about you and your comments, but it's another entirely to be so unrelatable to your constituents that they cannot stand to listen to you speak. You're not a politician, so this is not an issue, you can do what you want.

@Alby He's just keeping up his manly facade. Did you read his tweet?"I didn't even realize it was a kick." That assailant got rekt.

@kaniini @orekix @lain They severely depress wages and increase housing and medical costs just by being here even if they're not actively committing other crimes. They all have to go. Period.

@matrix FUCKING DESTROYED! I BET HE USES DEVIL STICKS TO EAT FISH!

@judgedread I never understood how any "constitutionalist" could support federal cops or increased domestic spying.What's your take on Tulsi? I think it's telling when all media is completely ignoring het, I think Yang has had more coverage.

@amerika Pretty interesting. It's important to have alternatives to clown world arts and culture.Without a vision for the future nothing will change. I think that was a big reason the left, toxic though it may be, was able to resonate with younger people for so long. Certainly their vision for the future is flawed and deplorable in more ways than one, but it existed. The Right has formed itself around tax cuts, the good old days, etc. Always just how you can reclaim the past, but never how this will impact the future.

The amazing thing is that Sargon wasn't rendered politically radioactive by taking strong, bold stances against the Globohomo consensus, but just due to his record of saying dumb shit in public. That's probably why almost nobody in the UK seem to be defending him at this point (that, and the country itself being cucked af).https://twitter.com/MisterAntiBully/status/1129721865277194240

@nerthos @Loki Having a military trained population with little if any familial attachments in the hands of the state seems pretty bad to me.I used to think similarily to this, then I thought a little more and found this question: Do I want the state to hold the loyalty of millions of mil trained niggers with a singular loyalty to said state that already seems to despise me?

@judgedread @Lanfear Well another piece of advise - aside from the entire platform that he ran on - that Trump ripped from Pat. Now if only he could rip some political acumen!

@wowaname @ChristiJunior @matrix Neither do ethics. It's all rules to the game to make you fail.

@Lanfear @TrevorGoodchild Well...what pop culture these days isn't trash let's be honest. He's not wrong when he says you can't spell crap without rap.

@Lanfear @TrevorGoodchild Maybe, he is of the tribe so I won't rule it out. But a lot of people can recognize the difference between (((neocons))) and normal conservatives these days.I'm also not so certain bashing standard, contemporary conservatives is a bad thing.  What is waiting beyond them? Compassionate Conservatives? LOL

@yolo I think it's pronounced: spik

@TrevorGoodchild @Lanfear He got rekt by a basic bitch BBC commentator and is a laughing stock in Europe, he is super pro-War, and way to snobby. I don't think his style will be able to hold much longer.

@rasterman @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @Terry If there was we'd be in better shape. They've had plenty of leaders try it just doesn't seem to stick.Hence the America problem.

@Lanfear I'd like to think he's not so self-absorbed, but I'd also like to think that he doesn't care about her.We'll see what comes of it, there has been a lot of talk about social media regulation which I see as some short term gains for some very long term damage. Stuff like this could really energize certain noisy parts of his base.

@Lanfear Such privilege, such entitlement! To feel you can @ the president and be listened to? Seriously? Well even if I don't necessarily agree on the message I hope she gets de-platformed.

@Terry @ChristiJunior @Lanfear And then everybody clapped.

@jack If this is your general outlook you kind of amplify the negativity. I wouldn't call half the people alive today worth shit and we actively encourage the multiplication of these people. The only upside to our system is that the people who support this tend to not reproduce themselves.Clinging to life is different than valuing life, simply because typically one can do more alive than dead. A dead man shares no secrets, a dead man - who's not a martyr - offers no resistance. At the same time we cannot all be martyrs otherwise there will be no one to properly take advantage of any potential gains.Following this same logic: a dead man cannot be a good father. If you die and have children, you will be unable to raise them or provide for them. Regardless if what you say about good sons today is true or not, it should not be the case. The first step should always be being a good father and providing for your children. You cannot hope for a good future if you cannot do that much.I think your sand analogy could mean to exemplify this, but it could also mean something else which is why analogies can be #BigGay at times. Too many are forming sediment on a poor foundation, we definitely need some to erode this sediment, but there is certainly no polishing going on currently and if there were it'd just be like polishing a turd anyway.Also I have no intention to read Siege for multiple reasons, but feel free to make the case if you feel it important.

@ArdanianRight Classical Liberals are strange. Have you considered working on Carl Benjamin's campaign?In all seriousness one does not control the elite, nor does a right-wing person consider a controlled elite as ideal.We have a controlled elite with barriers to entry now, all systems do to a varying degree.Replacement seems necessary - different than controlling, but I doubt that is possible if productive people keep justifying and legitimizing our shit system. This is why I mainly propose leaving the West and letting it burn. The free trade/movement ideas exacerbates their decline, some may say by design.Take advantage and get out now, while liberalism is still the prevailing order.White people as we know it are dead. We're among the last to "control" our own nations, our own governments will ensure that. Time to move on and become the next Jew, leave them, the useful idiots, the cattle, and the imported shits to die with ZOG.

@ArdanianRight That's a lot of words to say "yes."If you have skepticism towards democratic systems what alternative do you propose or support?

@ArdanianRightThat's because you're not right-wing, you're a liberal who's afraid of losing (((liberal democracy))) and the joys it has brought us.

@jackTheir own attempts to destabilize their occupied states are already back firing even without those issues. As per usual mixed feelings on that.

@Jdogg247 @judgedread Abortion is a strange issue. Honestly we should just find ways to subsidize it in "urban areas" and even be so kind as to offer free tube tying or vesectomies to "historical minorities."We've seen from Ohio that these people would actually be on board with that, they may even be OK with a 1000% tax so long as nogs don't have to pay it.Until it is possible to be explicit - or more explicit than that anyway - may as well find ways to make the commies kill themselves.Tusky_1558000999067_5LVET2J0KW.…

@augustus They exist.

@jack Let's for the sake of argument say that I agree with you on endless lives. In that case you're operating under the assumption that the future will be better regardless of yours or anyone's actions.If enough good men die pointlessly how will you're next life improve? It seems to me that in many ways the opposite is true.Is it not possible that those responsible for the state of the world return in a better situation than people like yourself? Perhaps a position more capable of making an impact? Maybe many operate on the premise that there is only here and now, believing the future to belong to their kin, thus contributing to the long-term efficacy and purpose behind their actions.Dying a "badass" does not necessarily mean having an impact. If you believe in endless lives, a large portion of which you die like a badass, but otherwise have no meaningful impact how is that not the pinnacle of nihilistic self-focus?

@jack I think I get your meaning, but this can be taken multiple ways. Accordingly, you’re either being pragmatic or nihilistic.

@judgedreadEverybody involved with Shapiro is either a nobody or one of his tribe. His entire career exists because of his (((identity))), which is ironic considering he's a National Review tier cuck.He always claims how "character" is paramount, meanwhile he decries the lack of policy debate in politics. Glad to see obvious shills get BTFO. Neoconservatism may have some residual institutional power, but in terms of the public mind, or as you may say memetic structures, it's beginning to fade.

So Ben Shapiro got completely fucking pwned to the point of running away by some normie chat show host and now everyone is saying that he's a talentless glass jawed faggot.Which is what I said when the great bales of astroturf promoting him as the second coming of William F. Buckley Jr. flooded the cuckservative blogosphere three years ago.

@jackI think the problem with this argument is that in many ways it amounts to unilateral disarmament.Take Muslims or Hispanics: just because both issues have the same (((root))) doesn't make them any less of an issue and certainly doesn't make them any less of a problem.If we divert all attention on the Jew we could no doubt defeat ZOG, but what then?

@orekixWe have a right to defend our countries' identities and not be flooded. This radical centrist "both sides" argument is retarded. Whites are constantly on the losing end because only our efforts to consolidate are ever seriously attacked. If you think these people give a fuck about your history, culture, systems, etc go to where they came from; leave your little bubble.I've been to multiple continents, multiple nations, lived within multiple cultures and talked to a variety of different people IN THEIR HOMELANDS! Have you? Do you even understand the relationship between ethnicity and culture? Can you fathom that a vast majority of this world has views much more similar to my ethnocentric viewpoint and maintain this mindset while immigrating?I hate very few people, but I'm not suicidal enough to think niggers, spics, or otherwise want the same society or culture as me - or even you.Open borders in $current_year is tantamount to accelerating balkanization and probably resulting in the death of many cultures and peoples. Only a fool invites in outsiders and treats them as if they have the same life experiences, heritage, or desires and provides them with the means to rival within their own home.@RehnSturm256 @deorsum @noyoushutthefuckupdad

@orekixYeah nation states will fade someday, but not in our lifetime. So as long as borders exist they will necessarily be at odds with open borders, when the world is ready for "open borders" it will no longer be called such because seperate states and thus borders will not exist.Advocating we employ methods that are beyond infeasible in the present is retarded.@RehnSturm256 @deorsum @noyoushutthefuckupdad

I just think it's going to be funny when these carvans just storm ports of entry and we let them in anyway - because let's be honest once someone thinks of it it will happen and it will continue to happen until illegal crossings are treated like an invasion.As a long term solution a wall is not enough.

@chara If one extreme exists then logically the polar opposite must as well.If one's argument in regards to a topic amounts to #NAXALT then why should that, probable kike, not be forced to defend each instance, person, case, etc. individually?How about, hypothetically focusing on exceptions we focus on the mean? According to this logic for the sake of argument we imply both #NAXALT and #YAXALT within every argument.Let's use the nigger example: are all nogs criminals? Invoke #NAXALT - OK would the all metrics of violence decrease or increase in the absence of niggers? The answer is clearly the latter, so it appears #YAXALT is most appropriate in this situation.Nuance exists only in execution, not in theory.

SOMEWHERE along Theater Street he had lost it. He remembered being hustled somewhat roughly on the bridge over one of the canals that cross that busy thoroughfare. Possibly some slant-eyed, light-fingered pickpocket was even then enjoying the fifty-odd yen his purse had contained. And then again, he thought, he might have lost it himself, just lost it carelessly.Hopelessly, and for the twentieth time, he searched in all his pockets for the missing purse. It was not there. His hand lingered in his empty hip-pocket, and he woefully regarded the voluble and vociferous restaurant-keeper, who insanely clamored: "Twenty-five sen! You pay now! Twenty-five sen!""But my purse!" the boy said. "I tell you I've lost it somewhere."Whereupon the restaurant-keeper lifted his arms indignantly and shrieked: "Twenty-five sen! Twenty-five sen! You pay now!"Quite a crowd had collected, and it was growing embarrassing for Alf Davis.It was so ridiculous and petty, Alf thought. Such a disturbance about nothing! And, decidedly, he must be doing something. Thoughts of diving wildly through that forest of legs, and of striking out at whomsoever opposed him, flashed through his mind; but, as though divining his purpose, one of the waiters, a short and chunky chap with an evil-looking cast in one eye, seized him by the arm."You pay now! You pay now! Twenty-five sen!" yelled the proprietor, hoarse with rage.Alf was red in the face, too, from mortification; but he resolutely set out on another exploration. He had given up the purse, pinning his last hope on stray coins. In the little change-pocket of his coat he found a ten-sen piece and five copper sen; and remembering having recently missed a ten-sen piece, he cut the seam of the pocket and resurrected the coin from the depths of the lining. Twenty-five sen he held in his hand, the sum required to pay for the supper he had eaten. He turned them over to the proprietor, who counted them, grew suddenly calm, and bowed obsequiously—in fact, the whole crowd bowed obsequiously and melted away.Alf Davis was a young sailor, just turned sixteen, on board the "Annie Mine," an American sealing-schooner which had run into Yokohama to ship its season's catch of skins to London. And in this his second trip ashore he was beginning to catch his first puzzling glimpses of the Oriental mind. He laughed when the bowing and kotowing was over, and turned on his heel to confront another problem. How was he to get aboard ship? It was eleven o'clock at night, and there would be no ship's boats ashore, while the outlook for hiring a native boatman, with nothing but empty pockets to draw upon, was not particularly inviting.Keeping a sharp lookout for shipmates, he went down to the pier. At Yokohama there are no long lines of wharves. The shipping lies out at anchor, enabling a few hundred of the short-legged people to make a livelihood by carrying passengers to and from the shore.A dozen sampan men and boys hailed Alf and offered their services. He selected the most favorable-looking one, an old and beneficent-appearing man with a withered leg. Alf stepped into his sampan and sat down. It was quite dark and he could not see what the old fellow was doing, though he evidently was doing nothing about shoving off and getting under way. At last he limped over and peered into Alf's face."Ten sen," he said."Yes, I know, ten sen," Alf answered carelessly. "But hurry up. American schooner.""Ten sen. You pay now," the old fellow insisted.Alf felt himself grow hot all over at the hateful words "pay now." "You take me to American schooner; then I pay," he said.But the man stood up patiently before him, held out his hand, and said, "Ten sen. You pay now."Alf tried to explain. He had no money. He had lost his purse. But he would pay. As soon as he got aboard the American schooner, then he would pay. No; he would not even go aboard the American schooner. He would call to his shipmates, and they would give the sampan man the ten sen first. After that he would go aboard. So it was all right, of course.To all of which the beneficent-appearing old man replied: "You pay now. Ten sen." And, to make matters worse, the other sampan men squatted on the pier-steps, listening.Alf, chagrined and angry, stood up to step ashore. But the old fellow laid a detaining hand on his sleeve. "You give shirt now. I take you 'Merican schooner," he proposed.Then it was that all of Alf's American independence flamed up in his breast. The Anglo-Saxon has a born dislike of being imposed upon, and to Alf this was sheer robbery! Ten sen was equivalent to six American cents, while his shirt, which was of good quality and was new, had cost him two dollars.He turned his back on the man without a word, and went out to the end of the pier, the crowd, laughing with great gusto, following at his heels. The majority of them were heavyset, muscular fellows, and the July night being one of sweltering heat, they were clad in the least possible raiment. The water-people of any race are rough and turbulent, and it struck Alf that to be out at midnight on a pier-end with such a crowd of wharfmen, in a big Japanese city, was not as safe as it might be.One burly fellow, with a shock of black hair and ferocious eyes, came up. The rest shoved in after him to take part in the discussion."Give me shoes," the man said. "Give me shoes now. I take you 'Merican schooner."Alf shook his head; whereat the crowd clamored that he accept the proposal. Now the Anglo-Saxon is so constituted that to browbeat or bully him is the last way under the sun of getting him to do any certain thing. He will dare willingly, but he will not permit himself to be driven. So this attempt of the boatmen to force Alf only aroused all the dogged stubbornness of his race. The same qualities were in him that are in men who lead forlorn hopes; and there, under the stars, on the lonely pier, encircled by the jostling and shouldering gang, he resolved that he would die rather than submit to the indignity of being robbed of a single stitch of clothing. Not value, but principle, was at stake.Then somebody thrust roughly against him from behind. He whirled about with flashing eyes, and the circle involuntarily gave ground. But the crowd was growing more boisterous. Each and every article of clothing he had on was demanded by one or another, and these demands were shouted simultaneously at the tops of very healthy lungs.Alf had long since ceased to say anything, but he knew that the situation was getting dangerous, and that the only thing left to him was to get away. His face was set doggedly, his eyes glinted like points of steel, and his body was firmly and confidently poised. The air of determination sufficiently impressed the boatmen to make them give way before him when he started to walk toward the shore-end of the pier. But they trooped along beside him and behind him, shouting and laughing more noisily than ever. One of the youngsters, about Alf's size and build, impudently snatched his cap from his head; but before he could put it on his own head, Alf struck out from the shoulder, and sent the fellow rolling on the stones.The cap flew out of his hand and disappeared among the many legs. Alf did some quick thinking; his sailor pride would not permit him to leave the cap in their hands. He followed in the direction it had sped, and soon found it under the bare foot of a stalwart fellow, who kept his weight stolidly upon it. Alf tried to get the cap out by a sudden jerk, but failed. He shoved against the man's leg, but the man only grunted. It was challenge direct, and Alf accepted it. Like a flash one leg was behind the man and Alf had thrust strongly with his shoulder against the fellow's chest. Nothing could save the man from the fierce vigorousness of the trick, and he was hurled over and backward.Next, the cap was on Alf's head and his fists were up before him. Then Alf whirled about to prevent attack from behind, and all those in that quarter fled precipitately. This was what he wanted. None remained between him and the shore end. The pier was narrow. Facing them and threatening with his fist those who attempted to pass him on either side, he continued his retreat. It was exciting work, walking backward and at the same time checking that surging mass of men. But the dark-skinned peoples, the world over, have learned to respect the white man's fist; and it was the battles fought by many sailors, more than his own warlike front, that gave Alf the victory.Where the pier adjoins the shore was the station of the harbor police, and Alf backed into the electric-lighted office, very much to the amusement of the dapper lieutenant in charge. The sampan men, grown quiet and orderly, clustered like flies by the open door, through which they could see an hear what passed.Alf explained his difficulty in few words, and demanded, as the privilege of a stranger in a strange land, that the lieutenant put him aboard in the police-boat. The lieutenant, in turn, who knew all the "rules and regulations" by heart, explained that the harbor police were not ferrymen, and that the police-boats had other functions to perform than that of transporting belated and penniless sailormen to their ships. He also said he knew the sampan men to be natural-born robbers, but that so long as they robbed within the law he was powerless. It was their right to collect fares in advance, and who was he to command them to take a passenger and collect fare at the journey's end? Alf acknowledged the justice of his remarks, but suggested that while he could not command he might persuade. The lieutenant was willing to oblige, and went to the door, from where he delivered a speech to the crowd. But they, too, knew their rights, and, when the officer had finished, shouted in chorus their abominable "Ten sen! You pay now! You pay now!""You see, I can do nothing," the lieutenant said, who, by the way, spoke perfect English. "But I have warned them not to harm or molest you, so you will be safe, at least. The night is warm and half over. Lie down somewhere and go to sleep. I would permit you to sleep here in the office, were it not against the rules and regulations."Alf thanked him for his kindness and courtesy; but the sampan men had aroused all his pride of race and doggedness, and the problem could not be solved that way. To sleep out the night on the stones was an acknowledgement of defeat."The sampan men refuse to take me out?"The lieutenant nodded."And you refuse to take me out?"Again the lieutenant nodded."Well, then, it 's not in the rules and regulations that you can prevent my taking myself out?"The lieutenant was perplexed. "There is no boat," he said."That's not the question," Alf proclaimed hotly. "If I take myself out, everybody's satisfied and no harm done?""Yes; what you say is true," persisted the puzzled lieutenant. "But you cannot take yourself out.""You just watch me," was the retort.Down went Alf's cap on the office floor. Right and left he kicked off his low-cut shoes. Trousers and shirt followed."Remember," he said in ringing tones, "I, as a citizen of the United States, shall hold you, the city of Yokohama, and the government of Japan responsible for those clothes. Good night."He plunged through the doorway, scattering the astounded boatmen to either side, and ran out on the pier. But they quickly recovered and ran after him, shouting with glee at the new phase the situation had taken on. It was a night long remembered among the water-folk of Yokohama town. Straight to the end Alf ran, and, without pause, dived off cleanly and neatly into the water. He struck out with a lusty, single-overhand stroke till curiosity prompted him to halt for a moment. Out of the darkness, from where the pier should be, voices were calling to him.He turned on his back, floated, and listened."All right! All right!" he could distinguish from the babel. "No pay now; pay bime by! Come back! Come back now; pay bime by!""No, thank you," he called back. "No pay at all. Good night."Then he faced about in order to locate the Annie Mine. She was fully a mile away, and in the darkness it was no easy task to get her bearings. First, he settled upon a blaze of lights which he knew nothing but a man-of-war could make. That must be the United States war-ship "Lancaster." Somewhere to the left and beyond should be the Annie Mine. But to the left he made out three lights close together. That could not be the schooner. For the moment he was confused. He rolled over on his back and shut his eyes, striving to construct a mental picture of the harbor as he had seen it in daytime. With a snort of satisfaction he rolled back again. The three lights evidently belonged to the big English steamer. Therefore the schooner must lie somewhere between the three lights and the Lancaster. He gazed long and steadily, and there, very dim and low, but at the point he expected, burned a single light—the anchor-light of the Annie Mine.And it was a fine swim under the starshine. The air was warm as the water, and the water as warm as tepid milk. The good salt taste of it was in his mouth, the tingling of it along his limbs; and the steady beat of his heart, heavy and strong, made him glad for living.But beyond being glorious the swim was uneventful. On the right hand he passed the many-lighted Lancaster, on the left hand the English tramp, and ere long the Annie Mine loomed large above him. He grasped the hanging rope-ladder and drew himself noiselessly on deck. There was no one in sight. He saw a light in the galley, and knew that the captain's son, who kept the lonely anchor-watch, was making coffee. Alf went forward to the forecastle. The men were snoring in their bunks, and in that confined space the heat seemed to him insufferable. So he put on a thin cotton shirt and a pair of dungaree trousers, tucked blanket and pillow under his arm, and went up on deck and out on the forecastle-head.Hardly had he begun to doze when he was roused by a boat coming alongside and hailing the anchor-watch. It was the police-boat, and to Alf it was given to enjoy the excited conversation that ensued. Yes, the captain's son recognized the clothes. They belonged to Alf Davis, one of the seamen. What had happened? No; Alf Davis had not come aboard. He was ashore. He was not ashore? Then he must be drowned. Here both the lieutenant and the captain's son talked at the same time, and Alf could make out nothing. Then he heard them come forward and rouse out the crew. The crew grumbled sleepily and said that Alf Davis was not in the forecastle; whereupon the captain's son waxed indignant at the Yokohama police and their ways, and the lieutenant quoted rules and regulations in despairing accents.Alf rose up from the forecastle-head and extended his hand, saying:"I guess I'll take those clothes. Thank you for bringing them aboard so promptly.""I don't see why he couldn't have brought you aboard inside of them," said the captain's son.And the police lieutenant said nothing, though he turned the clothes over somewhat sheepishly to their rightful owner.The next day, when Alf started to go ashore, he found himself surrounded by shouting and gesticulating, though very respectful, sampan men, all extraordinary anxious to have him for a passenger. Nor did the one he selected say, "You pay now," when he entered his boat. When Alf prepared to step out on to the pier, he offered the man the customary ten sen. But the man drew himself up and shook his head."You all right," he said. "You no pay. You never no pay. You bully boy and all right."And for the rest of the Annie Mine's stay in port, the sampan men refused money at Alf Davis's hand. Out of admiration for his pluck and independence, they had given him the freedom of the harbor.---From the February, 1903 issue of St. Nicholas magazine.

@druid You missed my purpose entirely. You let your ego win. If you think I wasn't baiting your threat you're a fool. If you think that I was too dumb to see or too craven to contest then you fully misjudged my character. But clearly I was, unfortunately, correct about yours.

@druid It seems that I was wrong about you. But by your actions I can tell that you know nothing if me.

@ChristiJunior @Ricotta Perhaps he is less cool than O had expected.

@druid @ChristiJunior @teetotaler I discovered what I needed. That's all that matters.

@ChristiJunior @Ricotta Hyde was an all round cool dude in my view. We didn't agree on everything, but he was interesting.

@druid @ChristiJunior I believe this is the furries equivalent of "Gas the Kikes Race War Now" LARPING.The difference being one is in direct response to a tragic reality which may destroy his people, and the other an attempt at identity via proxy to avoid facing the realization that his own people is actively being destroyed.Both are symptoms of a defeated man, lashing out and attempting escaping a reality which has deemed his existence, history, family, and people unworthy of a place in the world.TL;DR: Abrahamism won and you will die together without ever having considered fighting your mutual enemy together.

@druid I meant his issue in regards to broader society. In regards to the fediverse can deal with issues like doxxing via instance blocks, federation, etc.Personally, I'm here to learn, debate, shitpost, troll absolute faggots, and less commonly meet people. I've no interest in petty virtual social squabbles. @ChristiJunior

@druid @ChristiJunior argument isn't wrong, but I have 1 issue in the argument: none of those special privileges he listed should exist to begin with. Seems to me the root to exploitation lies elsewhere.

@druid Ok well that makes sense to me. Revealing information that was shared in confidence is a shitty thing to do on principle and should only be done in circumstances in which silence would be more detrimental than good.I have some reservations on this topic specifically in regards to members of what I presume you would consider a victim case, but I won't push it if you don't.

@druid No seriously, how would that even be accomplished on a forum? I could be trans for all you know, what do you have to go off? Are there tells? I just don't even see how that is possible on a forum.

@druid What is "outing a stealthed trans person?"

@judgedread I think you really overestimate their capabilities. It's the guy in the hoodie that stands out in a crowd, not the guy in a polo.

@Jdogg247Is that normie tier fuck even capable of making connections?He honestly seems like a basic bitch conservative to me.

@judgedread @Jdogg247 so many cry babies. They need social media to court the sheep into their dens of predictable commentary and solipsism. Use algorithms, bots, ads, blue check marks into guiding the sheep to the merch stores. I don’t disparage capitalism, pundits and the like, but they should use their “six figure” incomes and build shit already. Litigation and whining doesn’t stop the Left and only cough cough cough lawyers profit.

@judgedreadThe facebook part it the most difficult.I know we've had this conversation before, but nearly no one I know will remove it. It makes it pointless for me to consider deleting it without seeming suspicious.I just post some normie shit and happy bdays every now and again. In such circumstances I can't imagine total removal making you a less interesting target.

@AlbyWhat a cute couple. Will they be the poster boys for Biden's campaign?@Jdogg247

@charaThat's the White thing to do. People should always try to grow their own produce if possible.

@chara Very productive. I take it you buy as few produce from the stores as possible? Do you ever yield enough excess to sell?Sounds pretty fulfilling.

@tuxcrafting That hair though

@Jdogg247 Agreed. All Hispanic must cease reproductive activities immediately.

@onewaydotcom @judgedread @Jdogg247 If I ran a wordpress it wouldn't be for money, just the joy of spreading knowledge!

@chara How have you been? You've been relatively inactive recently, I hope this is because you have many good things happening in your life!

@Zilya @se7en This along with @chara is sound advice. Apply, see if you can line up another job, then demand action be taken.Being homeless certainly will do you no good.

@sjw @ffs is not wrong. I can't find a single flaw in that argument. Hands down the best, most coherent case we've seen yet!Also, @xeno is a fag. I've blocked that gross pedophile so I cannot see "his" response, but tell him that I hate him.Sincerely,The Nog Slayer@sjw

@sjw I just got this post, no I didn't see your questionnaire. Since you're talking to a hobbyist Neuroscientist with strong Psychology experience the answer is completely no.Age of consent doesn't really breach after the first wave of puberty. Knowing what sex is, and it's consequences are completely different issues someone has to comprehend in order to consent. It is scarring at the age of 9, not having even develop their first pube to be in anyway harmed with sexual intercourse or masturbation. I will not be replying to that thread, and thank you for listing it. Very very eye opening.Note, I mean males&females. A good ballpark is 25+, that way they are complete adults.The question of legality is abhorrent to me since I know how evil states/governments are. Have to agree with @IsaacWestcott there.

@SecftblgirlI had to switch to tusky to get context. Fedilab is fucking gay. It doesn't load convo like 50% of the fucking time. What a fucking kiked app!@ArdanianRight

@Secftblgirl @ArdanianRight That doesn't mean we have to listen to them and actually strengthens the argument for these segregated spaces to exist.

@onewaydotcom That's how you find interesting people! I mean you've got to block all the unfiltered tranny posters, but there are some worthwhile posters on other instances.

@jack @p @levi I'll agree that the modern English have no issue revising history.Did you know that according to the BBC the UK used to be 30% black? Even most of the nobility was black!

@wjmaggos > If a fetus is a person at 6 weeks pregnant, is that when the child support starts?You going to be willing to get a genetic test on that child? How about get married and stop putting out so easily? > Is that also when you can’t deport the mother because she’s carrying a US citizen?Let's follow the original meaning of the 14th amendment in which citizenship was determined by the mother's nationality and not magic soil. I see 2 people in need of deportation.> Can I insure a 6 week fetus and collect if I miscarry?If you're willing to pay those costs xDSarcasm is rarely endearing, especially when your primary concern seems to be pressing all the right hot button talking points without any real desire to discuss solutions.

@levi 1)  Don't be a prick to yourself.  Ever.2)  Don't be a cuck to any pastor. Most are selfish morons who were not called to Pastor anything. God made Church for us. Not us for a Church.3)  Be honest fair and altruistic as Christ was EXCEPT when choosing a mate.  Then you must be ruthlessly selfish.  Best for the both of you. White knighting a would be wife is death.4)  Eat healthy, stay away from porn and go to bed early.

oh nyo...

@RicottaMost people aren't worth it. They are just trying to catch your on some semantic or toss in something about "well that's a lot of effort, what if we jacked off instead?" or some other such fag mentality.Even many anti-leftist actors are fucking worthless because they will only debate symptoms, not causes. God forbid you try to fix a problem!@levi

@judgedreadFact: less blacks turned out to vote for Hillary than Obama.Trump has to get his shit together yes, but you're assuming the other side is just as retarded.@Secftblgirl @TrevorGoodchild

@judgedread @Secftblgirl @TrevorGoodchild Ok. So he wins the primary. They won't show at general.

This weekend, the border patrol apprehensions, (of the last 6 MONTHS), will be 500,000.In 2009, that was the amount for the ENTIRE YEAR!! Border Patrol & ICE have RELEASED 200,000 in the community since December 2018“Just a few days into May, this trend shows no signs of slowing down"https://fox5sandiego.com/2019/05/08/apprehensions-on-the-us-mexico-border-highest-since-2009/#BoycottMexico20190509_102932.png

@Zilya Catach and Release is a great policy. We could save a lot of money by eliminating the catch part though.

@Jdogg247 He should just make his own. He could fund it and could just write off the profit loss on his taxes, then not release them to troll the libs even more!

@Jdogg247As they should be.

@judgedreadThe "POC" likely won't turn out in any numbers for Biden and Co.@Secftblgirl @TrevorGoodchild

@judgedread @u From what I recall he has always disagreed with people, but always supported their right to free speech. I mean he did debate people like Richard Spencer on multiple occasions and has attempted to debate antifa in order to maintain his "radical centrist" persona.

@Terry @Lanfear @11112011 @1w4kvra @Alby @ChristiJunior @Oblivia @PussySlayer @Ricotta @p @rasterman Good butt though

@judgedreadI'm pretty certain they got rid of superdelegates after 2016. So this primary should be an excellent shitshow. They'll either scramble behind Pocahontas or someone more insane. The neolibs are only ahead now because of name recognition.@Secftblgirl @TrevorGoodchild

@ArdanianRight @Secftblgirl @TrevorGoodchild @judgedread Trump speaks simply and he's on Fox lile once a week. All is good.

@p @levi @judgedread Depending on company either pretend to know everything or prtend to know nothing, but never pretend to know something.

@judgedread @Secftblgirl @TrevorGoodchild Then the charade would be up.

@judgedread @Secftblgirl @TrevorGoodchild House begins the process, Senate actually deals it.

@TrevorGoodchild @rasterman Don't they teach French or German? What kind of nigger takes Spanish?

@Ricotta @benisnotreal @succucirno St Louis is actively chasing niggers out. They're doing God's work!

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild That's hands down the best reason I've seen to mark off a country.#HarryPotterNationalismOn a similarly pathetic note: I've talked to some Germans who honestly think that the migrants are going home peacefully. I had a good laugh!

@benisnotreal @succucirno OI! Missouri and Kentucky have lone been claimed by Ohio as part of the Mid-Western Dominion! We've been working on West Virginia too!

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild France is definitely a toss up. If the yellow vests do something, then maybe it'll turn around. That's a pretty big IF though!

@sjw Why armpits? I have been wondering this for awhile now. Is it just that #animearmpits are so smooth?

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild Those are useless numbers, 99% of them aren't worth shit. Come 2050 they'll be lucky to look like the US demographically, and they are making all the mistakes of the American Right and accepting mass immigration. "Minorities" are already 28% of French children, 30% of UK children, and 40% of children under 5 in Germany are "migrants." I just assume Sweden is even worse, because they are fucking dumb. This is barring any other immigration.That's Western Europe, which is the only part of Europe that really matters. Who cares if Poland or the Balkans stay "White" those countries never do shit anyway.

@benisnotreal @succucirno Don't be fooled, we all know what the South looks like!image.png

@Jdogg247 Racist that's what it is. We need to see more Mestizo and Black representation in there! I want all LGBTQIA+8UISASXXYZ propaganda to be at least 90% nog! We really need to suck the "urban youth" into that culture!

@jack @rasterman @TrevorGoodchild I hate when he yells in acrylic at me! Can't read that damn mongoloid slav language!

@jack @rasterman @TrevorGoodchild At times I'm ashamed to be an Anglo-American. I look at my fellows across the globe and so many just are unwilling to admit their precious Liberalism, Individualism (not to be confused with individualism), and Civic Nationalism failed.At this point we're fighting to be a respected minority in our own lands, rather than establishing dominance. The worst part is that theoretically the Anglo nations still have a decent chance to not only regain control, but establish neocolonies again. However, nation building to your benefit is somehow "out of touch with reality" while rampant domestic terrorism is somehow "part and parcel" and perfectly reasonable.



This fills me with the most amount of rage I have ever felt when looking at what sjws have done.What a fucking scumbag that you'd go out of your way to claim that a person this disabled is violent because he disagrees with your piece of shit article.This is why I don't agree or compromise with any of these fucks.

#TipOfTheDayAvoid #idpol when possible, but if harnessed by your enemy utilize it to crush them.  #Idpol is based upon something simple and primal, something easily fed to the masses. If you disarm in the face of it it will consume every aspect of society.

@Ricotta @Lanfear @p @Oblivia @judgedread @onewaydotcom Do I need to talk about car repair or camper trailers again so you'll ragequit unfollow me again? Look, I don't want this disinformation shit in my life. This insane idea that everyone who supposedly cares about the plight of White people and ends up suffering the full wrath of ZOG for their trouble as being Jewish is insane. There is nothing Ashkenazic, Sephardic, or Mizrahic about James Fields' appearance. There is nothing Jewish about his views. There is nothing Jewish about the outcome of his bizarre and illegitimate show trial. This is disinformation, whether you are consciously doing it or just repeating it. I've heard Horst Mahler was Jewish, I've heard Charlie Manson was Jewish, I've heard Hitler was Jewish, I've heard Elliot Rodger, who was clearly biracial and had an Asian mother, was Jewish. Quit it. The bigger question is why so many White people don't want there to be any authentic martyrs. If there are martyrs does that make this horror story too real for people? Is it too hard to believe that good people get unjustly punished and they're going to die a miserable death and we won't be able save them in this lifetime? Finally, I just want to bring this back around the point of the proceeding posts to undo the disinformation aspect here, which is that lines are incorrectly drawn. I believe in tribalism and that tribalists will eventually find each other. That Nehlen doxed Douglas Mackey because a paid GOP operative was attempting to blackmail him. That Gab banned both Nehlen and Little under false pretenses. And that I love radish sprouts and I don't care what anyone else says they're delicious. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1u59fgLE4o

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild @orekix @rasterman That was my point. But Sir kikes a lot make argument and leave before making a snide comment and jerking it to undertale gayanal porn was defending weimar and liberalism as good bevause he's a fucking retard who wants to see us be pushed towards either hitler or mudslime land!

@matrix That an Anglosphere specific feature?

@TrevorGoodchild @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior I'm with @rasterman on this one.

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild @orekix @rasterman Yeh, but I'm not defending Hitler; I'm stating the conditions for Hitler and hence WW2 existed because Weimar was a pozzed POS.

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild @orekix @rasterman A guy like Hitler doesn't understand that what he sees as reasonable is beyond reason for normal people.You don't get Hitler unless you make life utter shit. It just so happens that rampant Liberalism leads to exactly the situations necessary for a Hitler to rise.

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild @orekix @rasterman How did Hitler come to be? Oh right Weimar being fucking useless.

@matrix You should run for local MEP. If they insult you call abelism!

@orekix @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild @rasterman I literally already addressed this issue you fucking mong. You're real dumb aren't you?

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild @rasterman I like how @orekix frequently interjects BS and then runs when challenged. What an absolute faggot. If you ever see this fag try to act intelligent insult him. He is not worth a serious response.

@orekix @1w4kvra @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild @rasterman You're clearly a moron. Even if I grant your premise Weimar is the LCD in both scenarios. Weimar being useless is what ultimately caused WW2 regardless yoyr reasoning.

@orekix @ChristiJuniorThat and baiting the US in formally joining the war.@1w4kvra @TrevorGoodchild @rasterman

@ArdanianRight Even your average burger has no praise for Weimar. We all saw it as a weak failed state that led to WW2.@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild @rasterman

@ArdanianRight I have Germans around me telling me how wonderful Weimar was, how progressive and peaceful and happy people were. Then came Hitler.@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @TrevorGoodchild @rasterman

@ChristiJunior I have no idea how to guage that xD@1w4kvra @TrevorGoodchild @rasterman

@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra @TrevorGoodchild @rasterman Is that the guy Hitler Youth Leader PewDiePie boosted while totally not knowing the guy was racist?

@TrevorGoodchild @1w4kvra @rasterman Psycho Pass is a show. But the Chinese use it as an instruction manual much like the Anglo use 1984.

@IsaacWestcott He should go one better - instead of constantly going WELL ACTUALLY, he should just go on the Offensive and call out the media on spending so much more time on his rape joke than they do covering ACTUAL rape, including child rape, that Muslims in Britain are committing.The spotlight is on him - no reason he can't use this as an excuse to rub the faces of journalists and policemen in the Rotherham scandal. That might make them want to kill off this particular news cycle.

@Zilya You're calling out a fellow kike? Wow.

@Zilya It's a mystery!

@TrevorGoodchild @judgedread 99% of that 88% is useless so the numbers are meaningless. We act like under this ZOG system numbers matter, fact is they don't if they are channeled properly.Precisely 0 Western countries are worth supporting. From 98% Poland to 61% US, they are all utter garbage. They are all fucking useless cattle. Until mass EMIGRATION occurs or real resistance occurs nothing will change.Take your experiences from the West and leave it to die. Non-Western countries aren't going to allow Western elite to dictate policy if they have no meaningful backing.Surely there are at least tens of millions of "angry white men and women" in the US. Just go to Asia. They are still operating on the dumb paradigm "hur dur population growth" and will take educated workers in - some even need uneducated - and there is no reason not to form enclaves under globohomo order.

@Secftblgirl @TrevorGoodchild @judgedread The solution is obvious: just order it and let it be challenged.Then televise it and see what happens.

@ChristiJunior Should have pulled the :trump: and just claimed that he dindu nuffin.

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild Europe hasn't been fine for years. And seeing as how much of their "right" approaches idpol using the same failed tactics of the American right and crying "muh racism" I hope they get fucked too.I'd sooner help bugman China than let those absolute globohomofags prosper!

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild It's what's left. It's nit like the shitholers ate magically going to become people.Personally I've bailed on the West. I support as many aware Whites just leaving and forming enclaves in non Western, non Islamic countries.Force the idiots who remain into a situation where even if they are productive it's impossible to sustain the Boomers and their imported pets.

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild We'll see what happens. If he just lines shit up for the next guy administratively and judicially he's done something.The fact that the Right wing media didn't blow the Mexican soldiers on our territory accosting Americans was a real shame. That could have been good pretext to bully Mexico.

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild The judicial appointments are the one area that he's done OK. He's an oaf, but he's not fucked everything up.

@TrevorGoodchild @judgedread If it's just merit then we're fine. Do you think the average administrator is meritous? Who defines the standards? Ultimately that is complete abstract, just tinker with the metrics until you get the desired outcome. How do you think the Left infiltrated? By merit? LOL

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild Can he not use the military or national guard? That's the part that gets me: if he just orders it what are they going to do?We live in a Banana Republic, nobody understands how anything works and few care.

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild Just downsize and decentralize the most hostile sectors. They need an absolute reduction anyway.

@judgedread @TrevorGoodchild I don't know about that. A mixture of dumb luck in regards to a total decline in Hispanic arrivals and some successes on other policies coupled with the fact that Democrats don't have their shit together means he may have yet another chance.

@TrevorGoodchild @judgedread Trump should take after Boloroso and start clearing hostile administrators. The fact that he didn't day 1 is problematic.

@matrix Well in one sense she's right. There is at least one kind of labor in which women do all the work xD

@ArdanianRight I specified people like him using the failed tactics of the American Right.

@Alby Well at least the admited that being gay is bad.

@louisoft01 How racist

@orekix @Alby @RehnSturm256 People who see idpol for what it is: cancer. But insist on approaching it in the same failed manner of the American Right.The only way to destroy cancer is to go scorched earth. Unless you are willing to use White idpol to make idpol obsolete you will just follow the same route as America.

@RehnSturm256 @orekix @Alby I didn't say that I didn't want the animu girl!

@orekix @Alby @RehnSturm256 The tables will turn? Right because tge niggers are going to magically learn how to be people. We weren't even talking about "muh economy" you massive fucking autist.If it's any consolation there is one type of person I hate more than #nogs, and that's people like you.

@orekix @Alby @RehnSturm256 If you think all people are the same that's your problem.I suppose if we just sink more money into #nog neighborhoods and countries they'll become people. Just a couple billion more!

@RehnSturm256 @Alby @orekix Still doesn't have ape-like features like your common #nog. Nothing a little bleach wouldn't fix.Race isn't just skin color honey, it's just the easiest identifier of the taint.

@RehnSturm256 @orekix @Alby Don't confuse tanned anime girl as being synonymous with #nogs.The anime girl is far closer to being people than any #nog.

@chara It was an example of something small and still possible to claim. Their ideology is too pozzed - anti-racist and pro-gay - which is funny considering how they try to market themselves.If you know of any other small sects I'd be happy to hear.

@orekix @Alby Thank you for tagging that as sensitive. It indicates to me not to look lest my eyes be burned.Remember the only good #nog is one that never leaves its #shithole.

@orekix @Alby Anime isn't a race unfortunately. Couldn't even post a real nigger, are they that disgusting for you to gaze upon? Are you that much a bigot?

@orekix @Alby Niggers are good!

@judgedread Fact. Fags like that "poor white people are oppressing me import more spics now" nigger are useless to debate. Just insult people like him until they run away crying. Whether he creates an incelfag echochamber or logsoff entirely doesn't matter. So long as he remains afraid and ineffective is all that matters.

@judgedread What? The Nehlen debate?

@jack @p @ChristiJunior @Lanfear @Oblivia @judgedread @onewaydotcom I stand by my conviction that Nehlen did nothing wrong. Ricky Vaughn was a subversive do nothing kike lover.

@Are0h Do you enjoy being a nigger?

@p @Lanfear @ChristiJunior @Oblivia @judgedread @onewaydotcom Nehlen was a hero! Ricky Vaugn was an effeminate soy boy!

@ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild Yeh but otherwise they look the same.5/10 would repost

@brainblasted @jg How do you know you're a minority on the internet? There could be 500million niggers from Africa on the internet for all you know!

@Alby I remember back in 2003 my dad was on about how the neocons wanted to invade Iran and Iraq was just a staging point. Everyone called him crazy...but you know he was awefully insightful. If he was willing to look at Israel he'd have had a more full picture.

The leftists will call the Great Replacement theory racist all day long and play the guilt by association game, but they can't actually prove it wrong. It's almost like being "racist" is very different from being factually incorrect or dishonest....https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/is-demography-destiny/

@matrix I'm so confused.

@Johnny_of_the_swamp @Jdogg247 I learned that word last year. I couldn't help but insult him for using it.

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear I don't have a ton of faith in GenZ. I'd say they are more polarized, but that doesn't make them WN by default. There's probably 15% who could be considered WN at best. I'd say most are apolitical and detached, and maybe a fourth center-right.GenY is where I've seen changes. Getting fucked by colleges and diversity programs has given many a vengeance streak. GenZ is being pragmatic and avoiding college - We'll see where that leads.

@Jdogg247 FACT: The White man has kept such devices hidden from darkie for centuries. A RECKONING IS COMING!

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior @Lanfear TPUSA is useless and nobody really takes them seriously. Their focus is on campuses, but their top 2 people are Charlie Kirk - the most punchable faggot that I've ever seen - and Candice Owens - who literally looks like a baboon in good lightinf, that's not even a black joke SHE LITERALLY JUST LOOKS LIKE AN APE.They are both boring as fuck to listen to and if you ask anybody on a campus what they think if them it's always negative. TPUSA just lets mainline cucks think they are doing something worthwhile.Most GenZ and at this point GenY people aren't colorblind. That doesn't mean they are racist, but they are seeking answers. Hell the most open White Nationalist that I met at grad school was an Indian kid who has made it his goal to wake his White friends up to noggery. The world is a strange place.

@ChristiJunior @IsaacWestcott @Lanfear At this point Jews control both mainstream cuckservatism and shitlib politics.I won't be surprise if in 2-3 electoral cycles the Democrats will embrace communism while the Republicans will talk about how trannies should vote for them because in the USSR homos were thrown into GULAGs.

@Lanfear @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior Oh that...

@IsaacWestcott @ChristiJunior There is even a book about this called "The Holocaust: Made in Russia". Look it up on the internet, it's essentially a transcript of the absurd claims that the commies made (ie the evil Germans steamed Jews alive and made smashed their brains with special pedal driven bashing machines) which the Jews later had to drop because they were too absurd even for standard holohoax historiography

@rasterman @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior I've got something lolsy for you guys coming up in a bit. Some dots connected showing the absolute cognitive dissonance of the left in regards to fertility in the US.Considering you're all from outside the US I'll be interested to see if you've run into into similar patterns.I got to respond to p on the debate first, then I'll get this. I'm enjoying sunrise land so assume it'll take me bit!

@Lanfear @1w4kvra @ChristiJunior I'm out of the loop on this one.

@1w4kvra @ChristiJunior More interestingly all the death camps were those not inspected by allied soldiers. All of the camps west of the wall were found to not be death camps.When the Iron Curtain fell it was illegal to investigate, yet we just took the commies word for it.

@ChristiJunior @1w4kvra Over 100 times for no reason. At some point you begin to question...

@Jdogg247 "Joined the Alt-Right" is there a formal membership these fags get or is this just some Jew garbage?

@1w4kvra I'm thankful for her. She makes Jews look bad and brings to everyone's attention how they relate the holocaust to everything!

@admin Honestly, you know what I think Lyft/Uber drivers should do? Do what Upwork people do. Find some cool regulars and take the work off the platform. Cut out the shitty corporate middleman. Learn to accurately size people up. Give the people you trust and who trust you your number. They call when they want a ride and pay you in cash. Plus, why not cut out the govt middleman and save on your taxes as well? By going rogue you give the company the ultimatum to court you as a valued driver like they once did. People will have to be careful with phone tracking, storing their phone in a potato chip bag as a makeshift faraday cage, and the lying media will put out some urban legends about robberies and murders to discourage, but in order to bring big corporations to heel IMHO it's more effective to show that you don't need them on a regular basis than a one-time show of force.

@Terry @rasterman @11112011 @Alby @ChristiJunior @Oblivia @PussySlayer @Ricotta He's definitely a 110 IQ guy trying to act like he's 130 IQ. He can impress normal people and point out flaws in obviously horrendous ideologies. This has led him to believe that he is more intelligent than he really is.

@hfaust @JapanAnon I understood enough of that to believe that it is possible for me to install rather easily. Thanks!

@rasterman Japan's history with aristocracy is mixed at best. While it has existed for over 1000 years, it has not been in power for nearly that long. It also worked a little differently than Western aristocracies aside from royalty. I'm not even certain how it would be implemented in modern Japan.

@hfaust @JapanAnon How is IceCat? I'm using a meh browser atm.

this manga has no fuckin chill

@rasterman @Ricotta We'll see. There's hope, but we got the world's most incompetent actor - Trump - leading the charge. He's super American and definitely what we deserve, but my god it's painful.

@rasterman If they fix their work culture at the minimum and raise birthrates to 1.8 from 1.3 like Abe wants in the next couple years and maintain current immigration flow while deporting those who need no longer stay they'll be fine.The primary issue with the Japanese re-militarizing is the new issues that will cause - very similar to the US indeed. We'll see what happens, but I think enough Japanese are aware and have watched the US make mistakes.Truthfully they do not want the US to fail and most probably don't think it possible, I sincerely hope they don't fall for the same traps that we did.

@rasterman @ChristiJunior @11112011 @Alby @Oblivia @PussySlayer @Ricotta @Terry He's taking after Trump. Just saying dumb shit and getting free media coverage. There is a 0% chance he will not win and since he's too lazy to actually rape someone nothing will come of the charges.MASTERFULLY PLAYED!

@rasterman @Ricotta I never had any of that shit in school as an American. I honestly feel like the Midwest is a different country sometimes. We still make fun of Jews and use the term Jew in a derogatory manner in my state.I didn't even know anything about the holocaust aside from the number and that it involved killing until my 3rd year of high school. There was never a huge outcry about it nor a focus. We mostly just complained about the Civil War involving too many Ohioians dying and how we deserve more credit for winning the war and Sherman, or how the World Wars were unnecessary and the US should have avoided the conflicts in general.

It's one thing to not be able to hide your Powerlevel, it's quite another to make the Normies think that your Powerlevel is much higher than it really is.Sargon is basically Britain's answer to Mr. Satan, which predictably results in a beatdown from evil entities like Cell, The Sun, Buu and the BBC.

@rasterman Most foreigners in Japan are guest workers, so technically they should not stay; but I know people who have lived here for 20-30 years with families.It could turn into a DACA or Reagan Amnesty like situation easily. This is compounded by the fact that hafu and foreigners who have obtained citizenship are technically counted as "Japanese" on census since they only track nationality.So that 98% you see on stats is including guest workers as the 2% and all naturalized people within the 98%. In reality Japan is probably roughly 90% Japanese ethnically.

@rasterman @Terry @11112011 @Alby @ChristiJunior @Oblivia @PussySlayer @Ricotta Carl Benjamin was always a guy waiting to become an Ethnonationalist. His whole "cultural imperialism" is literally just a proxy, which he has admitted in the past. He's trying to out-Jew the Jew.As long as he keeps triggering the libs and pushing to deport Muslims he's a good lad!

@rasterman @Ricotta I doubt many outside the West/Orthodox aside from the Islamists really know about the holohoax.Argentina and Brazil are probably exceptions for reasons...

@IsaacWestcott @Ricotta [trying to process the fact of some people, anywhere on Earth, not knowing about the holohoax]Dude.confused_Jon.png

@rasterman Tokyo has a growing Pakistani community and Nigerian community and obviously Koreans and Filipinos as well. Westerners tend towards the countryside in my experience.

@rasterman @Ricotta The average Japanese person doesn't know what a "Holocaust" is. They tend to parrot certain things like "Hitler was a bad guy." but then will also say "Germany was a good ally." Honestly, the Japanese are pretty ignorant on all non-Japanese history and outside of American politics or Japanese politics know nothing.I don't know much anything about the emperor sadly, but I'll hope he is more traditionalist considering he is from an ancient line and the various restrictions on royalty regarding marriage.

@rasterman Depends on your thought process and areas I suppose. Something like 5-12% of city housing and 20-30% of city apartments are vacant. This is worse in the countryside.The issue seems to be too many people congeal in small areas. Tokyo for instance has a full 1/5 of the country's population. Expand that to the metro area and it becomes over 40%. Toss in the next few big cities and there is 60-70% of the population living in a land mass barely the size of New England in a country the size of the entire American East Coast.I plan on living about 1-2 hours from a large city out in the country somewhere. Get involved in a local community and just hike, climb mountains, swim, help the locals with stuff. It's a country that is not too hard to make connections or establish roots if you are willing to try.

@rasterman @Ricotta Most Japanese are not too political - which is kind of problematic as well. Those that are tend to be very open to the fact that (((white liberals))) are toxic. I mean most Japanese know they didn't fight on the wrong side of the war, it's not too much of a stretch for them.However, you do have dumb fucks in power who want to "...attract the rich jews to boost the economy." This is a direct quote of a Japanese politician, I kid you not.

@dubb5ack @Agni @hasya23 @FirstProgenitor It is still gentrification no matter how you look at it, regardless as to whether we have a non-profit managing how it's done to prevent possible long-term damage. Prices in the area rise, unemployed people or those dependent on government dole are forced to move out and younger, more wealthy people move into the neighborhood. With them followed new businesses, new jobs, and increased tax revenue.

@dubb5ack @Agni @hasya23 @FirstProgenitor It literally is restoration. The number of abandoned buildings or buildings just wrecked by niggers were astoundingly high. These buildings are old - pre 1940s - and generally in fine shape. What made the property values low was how many buildings were abandoned. Some streets in this area when I was growing up would have near 50-70% of the houses just boarded up. Rather than bulldoze them the company in our area is restoring them, selling them to people or renting them. What is being done to these buildings is quite comparable to Notre Dame actually.

@rasterman They just work to death, literally. Not just men anymore, women too. Their companies are so greedy they want you to work 50-60 hours a week on salary. The average pay here is something like $27k/year or $2250 a month. Stress and anxiety disorders are through the roof, relationships are trash because of it, people commute 1-2 hours one way to work. Changing companies is considered disgraceful - luckily foreigners get a pass of this faux pas -and can get you black balled from gainful employment.Child-rearing is nearly as expensive in Japan as in the State, but they make nearly half as much on average.If anywhere needs worker's rights laws it's Japan. Estimation in population drop is something like 1million/yr and that is to continue over the next 3 decades or so - so possibly sub 100million by 2040 from 129million in 2010.Until they fix this oppressive work culture they are on course for mass immigration or just phasing out. Automation alone is not going to save Japan as it could much of the West.

@dubb5ack @Agni @hasya23 @FirstProgenitor In our area is a non-profit real-estate developer funded by local companies. It's entire purpose is to build housing and entertainment for employees so they don't leave the area. It's being used as a way to prevent people from leaving the city due to stagnant population growth.The side affect happens to be that our unemployed and section 8 housing are going by the wayside; this is a good thing.

@dubb5ack @Agni @hasya23 @FirstProgenitor First off you love nogs and kikes, so you should support gentrification 100% by that logic.Secondly, I like how you ignored the whole "restoration" aspect and just assumed new building to fit your viewpoint. It's like I'm arguing with a snake who will shift the goalpost just to win an argument.First you cry about nignogs, then you say "oh but it makes more come, WAH."

@Agni @hasya23 @dubb5ack @FirstProgenitor Total faggot response. kys kike. blocked until I feel like spamming you!

@dubb5ack @Agni @hasya23 @FirstProgenitor It's been fairly good in my area. 30 years and running. The companies responsible are focused exclusively on our area and run by local companies - both small and large businesses. I've seen crime rates lower, employment rates rise, more factories move in and more tech job become available. Maybe some places do scam, but it's been good here.

@Agni @hasya23 @dubb5ack @FirstProgenitor go play your gay analsex discord webcam games you commiefaggotyou contribute nothing and deserve no punctuation literally just kys

@rasterman @Ricotta I'm still here currently, hoping to find a new job and just stay here. Tokyo is probably 10-15% non-Japanese; maybe a bit more. They let in a lot of guest workers over the last 8 years or so, but I don't know the details.I'm not certain the future immigration plans of Japan, but honestly it is not their top issue even with the 5-9% non Japanese living in the country. You pretty much cannot gain citizenship in Japan until you have culturally integrated. I could theoretically work here for 10 years, be fluent in Japanese, and have half-Japanese kids and not be guaranteed citizenship. However, work visas basically mean you can stay indefinitely so long as you are deemed economically beneficial.Regardless, I'll not be part of any political action of solution in Japan, just a guy trying to make my local community a better place. I pick up garbage, help old ladies across the street, do my job. If I got involved in anyway it'd probably be as a diversity pawn and I don't want to see that happen to Japan.It's a good place, it's traditional, it has its fair share of  issues, but if you are a Westerner tired of the commies and degeneracy of the West, it's not a bad place.

@Agni @hasya23 @dubb5ack @FirstProgenitor kys kike You're entire argument is just to support useless fucking unemployed faggots like yourself. You probably support UBI, go buy a cinderblock with your #yangbux and jump into a river with it.

@dubb5ack @Agni @hasya23 @FirstProgenitor First, I don't live downtown; that's for new rich people who don't know any better. So any hypothetical falling property values would not affect me in the slightest.Second, depends on the area. Within the cities around me it is mostly restoration projects, not new building construction. That or the production of new business or entertainment districts which artificially raise the property value.

@Agni @hasya23 @dubb5ack @FirstProgenitor Nice strawman. But considering you don't even know what gentrification is I'm not surprised.The people getting displaced are not working class.

@rasterman Both of those cities are still doing better than Detroit, Baltimore, name your shithole.Obviously the nukes did them no good, but they did well to recover. MacArthur really liked Japan and took time to make it a good place and create a system that worked for the Japanese.It's not perfect, but it's doing ok. I do have to say their work culture is terrible. That is something that they desperately need to address. It is responsible for so many of the ills and downfalls in Japanese society.

@Agni @hasya23 @dubb5ack @FirstProgenitor No. They move elsewhere. In the case of the States around me they tend to go back South or to California. All I care is that they GTFO my state. They can go get free shit from the coastal faggots or find "their roots" in the South, honestly idgaf I just want them gone.

@rasterman @Ricotta They've had nearly 80 years of political consensus in which nothing has really changed. But with declining population, growing strength of China, weakening of the US, who knows how the new era will treat them.They are very similar to the US demographically: in the sense that a vast majority of the country is countryside and about 70% of the population lives within a few big cities. So while it is a bit more extreme you can see similar divides.I'm an outsider looking in and likely will be for years to come so I can only say so much with certainty.

@Agni @hasya23 @dubb5ack @FirstProgenitor That's all gentrification is and people like you cry about it. "WAH muh poor people, I feel so bad. WAH" Literally kill yourself!

@Agni @hasya23 @dubb5ack @FirstProgenitor Gentrification is literally raising property values and moving in young professionals. That's all it is.It makes areas downtown good for people like me to visit ;)

@rasterman Politically I believe he has no power. But it is important to remember that the Japanese imperial line has reigned for over 1000 years. There is a deep connection culturally to the royalty and state shinto - the latter of which many factions in the mainstream seek to strengthen.I'd say his influence is not negligible, but historically they are used to being sidelined. The Meiji was a very brief period of Japanese history quickly supplanted by military rule once again.

@rasterman @Ricotta There is a mainstream movement here to repeal the section of their constitution which limits them militarily. With people like Trump supporting this it is possible that it happens within the next few years as there is no real opposition party in Japan at the national level.I've no doubt once this is repealed and the complications of re-militarizing occur their will be an opposition party and the LDP will have to define many issues on which it has been purposefully vague in order to stay relevant. Then it may end up looking like a more normal parliamentary system.

@dubb5ack @Agni @hasya23 @FirstProgenitor Just because I may dislike many of their actions and policies doesn't mean I'm not willing to support some of them. Least of which is something costly - meaning less money for their other projects - controversial - meaning they become a hate sink - and simultaneously clears undesirables from cities.If they can be the ones responsible for clearing out people who I generally dislike, use their resources to do so, and become a hate sink while doing it why would I not support it?

@rasterman Every time a new Emperor ascends to the throne they begin a new era. It is more important than someone like Prince Harry and on par with something like Queen Elizabeth being replaced - although since she has been Queen for so long it may not be quite as big of a deal.It is generally seen as a passing of responsibility from the older generations to the new ones and they keep track of years according to era as well as the typical Gregorian Calendar.

@Zilya @chara I don't see how anyone was supposed to take this chain of posts to be anything other than interventionist. I make a meme about #PirateNationalism and you go all "It's OK to be an ignorant bigot. I care about things."Chara rightly calls the meme normie globohomo trash and you act all snarky. Maybe if you didn't act like a snarky fag people wouldn't "misinterpret" you. Have you ever considered being an honest, decent human being?

@Zilya @chara What is the benefit of intervention in Venezuela? If geopolitics is just random interventions for "muh democracy" or "muh browns" then I don't give a fuck and rather vote for anti-war Dems and than any Republican who would be dumb enough to abide diverting resources and political capital towards such stupid issues.Neocons are useless sacks of shit who use up all political resources and momentum trying to make other countries not shitholes and in turn allow massive numbers of shitholers to settle here.Fuck them and fuck pointless interventionism. If you have a compelling reason other than "muh poor oppressed brown people" I'm all ears.

@Zilya @chara He's got a point on this one. Who cares if they are dying? Unless we are pillaging oil and got a way to keep those nogs out no reason to fuck with that hot mess.#PirateNationalism

@judgedreadHow many of these fags were just queers in hiding or products of queers in hiding though?I don't want to completely revert if we're just going to force a huge gay population into a situation where they may reproduce. That could become real problematic in the future!I think we're going to have a real life example of this in Japan here soon. The gays have always been underground here, but I don't think this declining birthrate is entirely without reason. Fag porn has been growing, same with gay rights groups. As the old fogeys die off the gays are becoming more open. It's definitely an issue and I'm not defending homosexuality, but we need to find the best way to deal with it long term.@ArdanianRight @rasterman

@judgedreadWouldn't this propagate the gay genes? Seems to me it'd be better in the long run to have it not be criminalized. Obviously things like the LGBT and gays adopting children need not exist, but it seems to me if we minimize their contact with children - adoption or via forced waifu having - those genes will be less widespread.I fully agree that what we're seeing today is not 100% natural or biological, which is why how we approach it needs to discourage such lifestyles and eliminate organizations for them - like the LGBT - without forcing them "underground" so to speak.@ArdanianRight @rasterman

@judgedreadThe same can be said for other diseases and genetic defects that modern human society allows to flourish and propogate.It can clearly be encouraged to manifest within individuals who would not express symptoms under normal circumstances - part of the reason organizations like the LGBT will always be the enemy of sane people anywhere.

@a7 Are they growing? What's their impact? Are they just a noisy few? I've heard that something like 10-15% of Catholics don't recognize Vatican 2 and are more traditional. The issue being: can one be Catholic if he rejects the Vatican? Is this just another Protestantism? Will things like Vatican 2 be possible to roll back? These are issues that need be addressed before such groups become relevant in the slightest. Until then they are subservient to the current degenerate pope and cardinality.@ChristiJunior @PussySlayer @amerika @jack

@ChristiJuniorI'm not certain this universalism that mainline Christianity has taken on can be reversed. It has grown so inclusive that it doesn't even fight to maintain credit for the culture that it created anymore, just "Judeo-Christian" culture.Offshoots like Mormonism are explicit enough in their text regarding things like outmarrying, but again runs into the issue that the barriers for outsiders to join are not high enough.Leyan Satanism meanwhile has higher barriers to entry, but is perhaps not ritualistic enough - I'll be honest I don't know enough about their inner workings to properly make this judgement. I do know it is very clandestinely organized, which could be advantageous.Things like Shinto would likely lead towards integration into the Japanese, there are worse fates certainly but it's still not my preference.I know people like Dredd think Christianity is done for and most who cling to it to any extent, myself included, have little faith in it seeing it constantly favour outsiders over its own.@PussySlayer @amerika @jack

@rasterman @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Short term that can be attacked via proxy: requiring adoption only be available to married couples, adoption restricted to couples who have proven to be good parents (ie. Already have kids of their own), etc.Long term more identity/statistically based rulings can be applied. But generally they do not reproduce.

@ChristiJunior @jack @PussySlayer @amerikaI've seen all of you post, or in the case of @amerika write, about this topic to varying degrees.I've been thinking of the importance of religion in the formation of any future enduring ethnogroup. For instance the Japanese have Shinto/Zen Buddhism and the Chinese Zen Atheism. Both of these instances have become more culturally focused and less ritual focused overtime.Christianity seems to have done the opposite and instead sought to subjugate more groups via increased rites and rituals.I think the task of creating a new religion is insurmountable, but wonder if an existing group holds potential.Mormonism is spergy at its core and technically has potential, but I wonder if it's not already too large. Satanism is definitely small enough and I doubt any if us disagree with its basic tenants, but seems fixated on anti-Abrahamism, while also being possible too fringe. Regardless, I don't see Secular Atheism as a viable social structure going forward. It has already shown itself to be woefully incapable of maintaining a civilization or culture and its only claim to fame can is its successful bastardization of Christianity.I think some form of ethnoreligious association would be useful in an increasingly globalized world and serve us well as a proxy to race. It's among the reasons why Jewish Identity is beating White Identity. White was too tied with Universalist principles and religions, wheras Judaism was more exclusive.I'm hoping you guys have a little more thoughts on this than myself.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Pence is my kind of Evengelical. He is right on both economics and social issues. In regards to Russia and Israel his inner Boomer is revealed, but other than that he's OK.It is imperative to not alienate people like him while courting the fags. Which is why I said just cite nog violence against fags constantly and offer "right wing solutions" - ie remove kevab and deport "radical spic catholics."

@Prodigal I think most the kikes on here already blocked me - the mongs def instance blocked.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight They won't mobilize without effort, much like normal whites won't.Trump is too aligned with Evengelicals - who are truthfully enemies in more ways than one - to stand a chance with the fags ever.The best thing for right candidates to do regarding fags in my opinion is cite Islamic or Black crime versus fags, but offer nothing. At some point fags like that "Walk Away" guy - who I think is gay - will start their own competing version of LGBT. They'll likely run alone in left leaning areas - college towns, Cali, Chicago, possibly some mid Atlantic states - so they won't really pose a threat to us, but they'll divide the left vote.

@Prodigal You abandon me for weeks and then refer to me using a low brow colloquialism?WTF

@rasterman @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight Once you realize that it's the (((LGBT))) that is the enemy, not Western fags possibilities open up.In the past we all accepted that whole "privacy in your bedroom argument" because there was truth to it and in a closed system benefit even.The more fags in the open the less competition and the less likely the more dedicated concealers reproduce and propogate gay genes. I'm not convinced homosexuality will ever fully dissipate, but I'm pretty certain Abrahamism contributed to its increased prevalence in more ways than one.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight I've always got along well with fags, even after I reveal that I'm "basically an ethnat." Maybe I've just lived among the gays for too long and gone soft, but there is a genuine hatred for diversity in that demographic - many feel they no longer belong in the LGBT.Think of them like fat women: you don't want to fuck them, but they still need to feel pretty. Many don't find #nogs attractive anyway so bashing them can become second nature once they realize you're not (((anti-racist))). As long as you're open to trying new things - not sexual - you can learn how these people tick. As far as temporary alliances go a demographic that doesn't reproduce is probably a wise choice.

@ArdanianRight Will the unholy alliance of fags and the far right come to be? Was old Richard Spencer right all along?

@judgedread @amerika Yep. The assault on the white working class consists of outsourcing their jobs, settling hostile invaders next to them (on welfare, naturally), and getting them hooked on addictive narcotics or just letting themselves drink themselves to death in order to numb the pain.The upper-middle class that is still salary dependent (doctors, lawyers, high-level tech guys, small business owners) can't be done in that way. So what you do is force them to cocoon and atomize, paying increasingly higher costs in order to avoid the diversity (property taxes, expensive neighborhoods, private schools). Coupled with the threat of status loss and becoming instantly unemployable if the media gets wind of the fact that you're a crimethinker. The upper class that is not salary dependent (financiers, trust-fund socialites, entertainment moguls) is actively participating in selling out their countrymen. With very few exceptions.

@Cyph Sounds like a useless #sandnog day. I hope another nobody makes a name for himself removing kebab today.

@jack @ItsOkToBeAdamic What? Links?

@luckyp3616 @ItsOkToBeAdamic High tech solutions for a developed and unified people.We don't have the prerequisite population. Got some cleaning to do first.

@ItsOkToBeAdamic @luckyp3616 What's 1/100 a genome?If minority is defined as anyone with at least 1 great-great minority grandparent, and couples in which 1 parent is a minority are limited to 1 child the population and genome will dwindle.This is possible when the minority population is small enough. However, most of the West has passed that threshold.

@luckyp3616 @ItsOkToBeAdamic I too support eugenics. None of my arguments exclude bad Whites. I am pro Law and Order.

@ItsOkToBeAdamic @luckyp3616 Globalization. There is no left alone. However, there need not be endless aid either.

@ItsOkToBeAdamic @luckyp3616 I think small minorities are fine. It needs to be integratable. If the numbers will never overwhelm or compete it will become necessary.Genetic integration overtime is possible provided manageable numbers.

@luckyp3616 @ItsOkToBeAdamic #NAXLT isn't really a winning argument. I've never called for nigger genocide, but dwindling their populations in the West towards 0 over a century or so certainly would be ideal.1 Child Policy and encouraged repatriation/expatriation!

@luckyp3616 In current year that'd face heavy resistance, but it's a noble goal. The issue is the barriers to this are also the targets.We're treading dangerously close to "pre-crime" enforcement. Which is why I tend to think that focusing on controlling whose here is a little more conducive to freedom in the long run than dealing with issues in increasingly diverse and complex environments - which get us PsychoPass xD

@IsaacWestcott Also, it is very possible that black people have a higher occurence of this gene. I still think we should target the gene itself rather than just by skin color. We will weed out plenty of bad whites, asians, etc. as well.Y'know, weed out the SJWs. Maybe we can someday develop something to put in the water that will change that gene to it's more civilized version. Until then... well...

@luckyp3616 Proper policing and eugenic processes could have the same effect, so if you're suggesting using this gene to target sterilization...ok I'm in.

@luckyp3616 My point isn't to excuse SJW or criminal Whites. It's why make excuses for these people or try to use it to ignore the statistical reality? Do you now feel safer going to south side Chicago? At the end of the day these issues were always genetic so I'm not surprised genes are linked to behavior even slightly.Are we going to start sequencing genomes to decide whether or not to let people in? Or are we going to use a less invasive proxy?I just don't see to what end this is going. It's interesting and worthy of study, but if niggers really require genetic modification to become bearable...like WTH? There are so many better areas to invest resources.

@matrix @rice @karen That's some sekkuhara!

I think we need to not focus on ethnicity and skin color, and instead focus on the CDH13 gene. Perhaps many black people have a problem with their CDH13 genes which make them uncontrollable.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/two-genes-may-contribute-to-violent-crime-study-says/

@matrix Pretty fucking intense though, amir?

@luckyp3616 What's the difference in rate of occurence between the 2 groups? It's also surely not the only genetic factor to consider.People put so much effort into justifying niggers it's amazing! At some point the masochism has to stop.

"Oh he said the Nword, make him resign""Oh he told her 'make me a sandwich', make him resign""Oh, she was having nude public sex with her husband on a beach she was reasonably expecting to be vacant, she's a hoe, and hoes gotta go..."Nah, weaknesses make us human, and it is that knowledge and using it to pull the emotional populations heart strings is precisely why men can now use women's bathrooms, why Kindergartners are having drag queens and trannies lectures them about sex... it's too much...we need to push back, faults be damned.Trump and Milo's popularity prove that, and I am in no way endorsing either.

@jack @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @sarchasm @WIR Anglos should be prideful. Why shouldn't we? I am annoyed that everyone is viewing the Anglo and Western Europe at large a lost cause as the problem or expandable.I've nothing against Slavs, but I don't want my descendants to become one. I think it best all Euros work together.If Russia falls it's a disaster, if the UK falls it's a disaster, same for any other European nation.We've lost enough in the 20th century. It's time to stop losing.Western Europe is indeed approaching Anglosphere levels of ruin, but that's no reason to abandon either.You too believe that globalization is going to be part of any solution moving forward. Hence we need work together and not just blame the Anglo and think Poland and Co are going to hold the line alone if everywhere else goes to shit.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @sarchasm @WIR Collapse is literally the worst scenario. Being a super majority of a bloc with no sea access surrounded by hostile states is not a future good for any Europeans, east or west.The muds are dumb, but not so dumb that they can't operate the miltech of these nations.Demographics are destiny, but theres more to reality than demographics.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @sarchasm @WIR Real Europe? The Slavs? And are you advocating for a collapse? Geography isn't meaningless. Say aware Whites do flee to those areas: surrounded with little to no sea access. Not promising at all.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @sarchasm @WIR Will it stand in isolation?

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @sarchasm @WIR 51% of Bosnia is Muslim.59% Albania (Skanderbeg is rolling in his grave).33% Macedon.The rest of those countries range 2-10%. This is a sizable number of the Balkans population overall - even if not the majority.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @sarchasm @WIR We'll see. Europeans while oft divided stand or fall together. They always have.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @sarchasm @WIR Russia's oligarchs are more Jew'd than the West's. Ask @1w4kvra about that.There are already sizable Muslim minorities throughout the Balkans, tge increasing presence of them in the West provides access to financial and military tech that they would otherwise not have.Frankly, I don't think Eurabia is going to happen in the West, but if it does as you suggest Central and Eastern are fucked too.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @sarchasm @WIR I grew up in WASP house, in a WASP town, surrounded by WASP ideals. I harbor no desire to become a Slav or Med.Euromutts tend to make up the lower class Whites. They are a needed assest certainly, but not leadership material. You lose the Northwestern Europeans and there goes any hope for the European genome. Slavs, Meds, Iberians and mutts will be quickly subjugated.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @sarchasm @WIR You're not going to see Polish pogroms. Look at who owns Polish Media. A hell if a lot of News Corp.These media companies are deep throughout Europe. The fledgling economies of Eastern Europe would welcome some shekels from Jews after they've pillaged the core of the West.The people may not, but see how they sing after 40 years of harsh indoctrination.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @sarchasm @WIR What I mean us theres no reason to believe this process won't happen again. Eastern Europe isn't exactly hostile to Jews, you think they won't follow?You think you'll get the Slav mutts to go full Nazi? The subversion will continue until consciousness rises or we die and the Asians ROFLSTOMP the northern hemisphere.There's no more white flight, it's a dumb failed strategy. We hold, or we die. It's that simple

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @sarchasm @WIR If the future is truly just Euromutt, fuck it just mix with the Asians. They are ethnocentric and hate outsiders, drop the pretenses and go for the burn.

@PussySlayer @AdrianLeigh @onewaydotcom @judgedread @rasterman @Oblivia He's not known as the Crying Nazi for nothing.

@ChristiJunior @sarchasm @WIR It's a valid argument and criticism of our people. If your very existence is truly "racist", but the "solution" (ie prostratiom to hostile outgroups) an anathema to yourself and your children your survival instinct should kick in and tell you to fuck it. Biological constructs exist to propagate their own survival, not the survival of others.Whites shouldn't willingly accept getting shit on, niggers don't. Whites are certainly not blameless. We still nominally control our nations, but leave the doors opened and vaults unlocked.

"Allahu Akbar" - Prime Minister of New Zealand

@Ricotta @nerthos Let's hope so. I resent that small brown girls are doing what White men should be doing in Congress.Weimerica is much more complex than Weimar, and many more dangers abound .

@dcvoter Troll the NSA. Open up rank porn while AFK and force those fags to watch it!

@xeno @DJWalnut You might as well argue that Christians "don't hate" pagans. There's a fundamental incompatibility between the individualistic idea of "traditional man" (Think the Hero's Journey, not some man from a few centuries ago) and the socialised idea of intersectionality.In short, the fundamental combative zero-sum-game nature of masculinity is so at odds with the intersectional feminist worldview that the only space it makes for such men is as acolytes who are tolerated so long as they "make progress" towards the "light" of socialised and civilised thinking.This is why only "defanged" masculine archetypes are accepted: the manly biker is only welcome so long as he is gay, or otherwise rendered no "threat" to women. (The free mind, on the other hand, would recognise that his sexuality has little bearing on his nature.)Just as I often hear feminists say "the patriarchy hurts men too", I will respond: "Intersectional feminism hurts women too," for it seeks to socialise them, to collectivise their strength and identity; for all such people refer to "queens" who "slay", this school of thought defangs the free woman who would be heroine or mother or free-witch, because the actions it will conscience for her are only those which make sense to the collective. This is why intersectional feminists need an "other" despite their banner if inclusion: and that "other" is justified in terms of perceived privilege. Therefore, in a framework that teaches that patriarchy is the principal cause of oppression, those who are "privileged" under it will never be wholly welcome. Or else where would the safe feminist witch target her curses? Where would the heroine strike? From whom would the mother protect her children?But it is inevitable that not everyone can follow the path of self-as-sovereign. Oh well.(I have argued regarding intersectionality here because it is the cornerstone of the social justice movement. As regards schools of "feminism" which are, in fact, just the philosophy of strong women who build their own tower from whatever empowers them, I would call these what they really are - "satanism" - and applaud them thoroughly. But such women, by their very nature, would care little for recruiting others, for wasting time on solidarity, and for this I salute them doubly.)

@Ricotta @nerthos They are not invincible and certainly not more intelligent. It's the lack of ethnocentric behavior in Whites that did this, if restoring that consciousness makes your path possible, sweet. If you manage to work that out I'll be with you. Keep in mind my style has the same desired end as yours. It's a step by step process. You don't go from ZOG to gas the kikes in a decade, unless some serious Weimar shit goes down - and keep in mind Weimerica has le56% problem.

@Ricotta @nerthos I'd never trust a Jew. But you can trust them to always act in what they see as their best interest.Direct extermination failed, partly due to them being a diaspora population. Getting them to Israel can put them all in once place and once most are there more long term solutions become possible.In the interim don't trust the Jew and if possible bar them from any positions of power or wealth. Institute quotas, etc.Even if a partial NSesque platform (probably only borderline ethnat in the case of the US) can be cobbled, the political capital to exterminate a people is huge.



@ricotta @IsaacWestcott We could poison the shekel

@Ricotta @nerthos That was the original intent of Israel. The English concocted it to punish and contain the Arabs while making use if the Jew.Looking at Europe, it doesn't seem like all that unrealistic a strategy - emigration to Israel from Europe is growing fast. However, dislodging the Jew in the US will not be as easily accomplished.

@benisnotreal Despite Trump's weak SOTU and lack of gain on the immigration grounds he has done wonders for consciousness and pushing discourse.It's a start, but even with the RAISE ACT and increased deportations the US can remain 60% by 2060. That's assuming more populism doesn't kick off.As much as I hate his seeming cucking, he is turning shit around.#Yang2020 would definitely be a great debate to see. I'd like to see Trump slip some mean race words and anti-Chinese dialect into the debates.Let's hope Yang gets the nomination./end leftist rant

@matrix Most niggers don't know of this word, and thus become very offended upon hearing it.The irony is that the word actually perfectly describes most of them and as such they actually should be offended, but for a different reason. xD

Real talk, the New Zealand attack has only made me hate Muslims more, due to being reminded of all the freedoms we are losing to appease Muslims, and seeing how much more value is placed on Muslim lives by our governments.Every time Muslim terrorists murder White people, we're told to not overreact, that the attack had nothing to do with Islam, that the terrorist was just mentally ill, we're warned about the danger of an anti-Muslim backlash and of course, there's never, ever serious talk of cutting back on Muslim mass immigration. The contrast with the current freakout by Western governments, their authoritarian internet crackdown and the assault on gun rights is stark.

@11112011 We're not lucky enough for it to be a Muslim purge are we?

@comfy Who doesn't wake up at 4am?

@detectivehyde @karen @rye TBH I like the mid period knights more than the late period ones, where they had a damn lot of autonomy.Most people think of knights as just western samurai, that are given weapons and armor and money to fight for their lord, but that wasn't the case at all times. At one point they were pretty independant, they inherited the title from their fathers, and worked along their villagers and household, went on adventures to gather fame and wealth, organized their own tourneys to hone their skills and reputation and capture eachother and gain loot to then give out to make friends and give back the captured knights to their wives for ransom. So most of the time they weren't serving anyone, they were either working/administering their land or adventuring.The only real "serving" they did was band together and rally their militias to fight outlaws and raiders, and when their land was invaded, so it was more about having the common interest of defending their country from foreign invaders than kissing the king's ass.And a knight has no reason or limitation when it comes to learning skills other than warfare, in fact a damn lot of them were into stuff like arts or religion or knowledge or even secretly into magic, as they had the resources and time to pursue such interests.I pick the knight archetype for quite a few reasons, but it doesn't keep me out of slowly dualclassing into wizard.

@DetectiveHyde I'm a millenial raised by the greatest generation. I'm certain my childhood stuff is a bit odd by most standards, but no doubt degenerate to someone.Like you say, do the best you can. Need to preserve the apple if only so your progeny can plant its seed. I'm just removing the rot in the interim.

@DetectiveHyde I still have my stuffed animals and blankets. I'll keep them until handing them down to my own children. I'm not letting them fall into the "my little pony" or whatever degen fad shit is being pushed on kids.

Everything is going to fall apart. It's so sad. Every day, everything innocent is under constant bombardment. I can't save it all. Not all of it can survive. I'm sorry.Please do your part to preserve innocence. Your children will need it.Next time you see a jigsaw puzzle of a sweet scene, or a wooden toy, or an old children's book written before the brain-poison became the norm, or a rag doll, or a little farm set, or a little cuddly animalDon't listen to that implanted voice that tells you to scoff at it. To say "this is not for me", to say "such things do not belong in this world."Keep the torch of childish innocence alive. Our children will need it when they inherit a better world.Do not replace the innocence of a rainbow with the corruption of a pride flag.

@ArdanianRight @comfy IMO the breaking point was when they did the "kings no longer elect bishops" reform to have direct influence on each kingdom. That collapsed the religious unity of Europe. Then as a direct cause of that greed Luther and Henry VIII happened, Europe definitely split itself into two, and the Ottomans grew unopposed.The retards never understood that the only way to fight other religions for geographical influence is to offer a better deal, not undermine society, as Europe isn't a sandbox isolated from the rest of the world.

@chara Why not both? Have you ever seen hardcore dykes? They are basically men.Even in non-polygamous scenario if there are spare women if a husband dies someone else can marry her and have kids.Women are more valuable than men and thus require more protection and responsibility. Because what women do is more important than what men do.

@chara Niggers aren't, look at Africa - rape is their preferred/natural method of reproduction.But are niggers really human?

@chara It's not a judgement of morality. It's the fact of the matter that 1 of these scenarios can yield multiple children, the other cannot.The gay men can be sent to die in war or elsewhere, but gay women are valuable just by virtue of being women.1 if these scenarios leads to reproductive loss - gay female - the ither doesn't - gay men.

@chara Biologically speaking lesbianism is far less practical.Every lesbian is 1 less person who will have children. However, if men are gay this downside could be minimized via polygamy (1 man multiple women).If there are 100 people, 50/50, 10 lesbians would mean 10 less people having babies, but with 10 fags the theoretically 10 single females can still get with a normal man and bear children.

This will literally encourage people to not get jobs. There are ways to make this work for productive people, but no Communist Chink Chang won't do that.

@igeljaeger Just for you bb ;)

Trolling in its purest expression is arbitrage on the discrepancy between ego and reality. The most worthwhile targets are always those who have an inflated ego or delusional sense of self, and trolling requires nothing more than cutting through their bullshit by reflecting reality back at them. Trolling is a service to the common good because most learn from the encounter, returning them to reality in a self-correcting market - or teaching them to not expose themselves to it; even if the denigrative experience leaves them loathe to admit it was ultimately for their own good. But lolcows are the gift that keep on giving, the infinite goldmine, because their lack of self-awareness, social pathologies or otherwise psychological weakness prevent self-development, resulting in them repeatedly and predictably returning to inequilibrium, to that delusional personal fantasy so comforting to them, yet so glaringly vulnerable to the troll, ripe for takedown.

@chara Ching Chong Chang represents the death of White America. If he gets in the Democrats will have 0 resistance to leftist kikery on any issue.

@chara @Jdogg247 @Prodigal @Terry Reconquest. It seems we have a history of reconquest because we always allow weak men to take control and lead us to ruin. Regardless, the continent was retaken, and now it is being lost once again. At this point we are so diluted, that if we do not stop the current invasion our genome is pretty much fucked, which is why I'm a fan of re-consolidating elsewhere.Race has fuzzy borders and there exists a gradient, however, these borders are worth preserving and refining.

@Prodigal @Terry @chara @Jdogg247 There is evidence that Northern Europeans were in parts of North America prior to what we commonly think of as the Ameridians - which are believed to have come from Northern Asia/Siberian area.Who got here first is anyone's guess, but they came from opposite ends and the West won over the East - this of course being the American coasts, not our normal understanding of East vs West.Regardless, this Asian originated population become the core stock of what we think of as Ameridians and they absorbed the Northern Europeans who were here prior.The gradient of European/Caucasoid DNA tends (maybe tended at this point) to be stronger in North Eastern Americans and lessens as you move West and South, dwindling to the point of non-existence in South America.

@1iceloops123 @PussySlayer That guy has a pretty big head for a Russian, just saying.

@Terry @chara @Jdogg247 Do recall many Ameridians range from between 10-30% European DNA.There is a lot of evidence Scandinavians and Northern Europeans were here before the modern Ameridians.That's excluding other fun genetic shenanigans that can occur during meiosis and gametes in general, as well as epigenetic factors.

@chara @Jdogg247 @Terry Australia has similar potential to the UK, but some of their laws regarding data privacy and encryption (it's illegal), make organization a little more difficult.The Chinese are pretty entrenched economically, and while you could technically kick them out you'd need to be organized and gain power to match their economic might - so it's a catch 22.However, it is within the sphere of the Commonwealth and could fall in line with the UK if things can be turned around at the core.

@chara @Jdogg247 @Terry Because I think those very same laws can be applied towards our enemies if harnessed correctly.I'm just uncertain on Russia and their large, porous border is a liability with such a low population [150mil is so few for such a vast area]. That autonomy of the Muslim regions is also pretty questionable.The UK is an island, so if things can be turned around it is much easier to hold the borders, the trade and police infrastructure is already in place, and its culture much more amenable for an exodus from the US. The infrastructure is not friendly now, but that can, and will, undoubtedly be changed.

@Terry @chara @Jdogg247 It won't. It will become Latin America.

@IsaacWestcott @Jdogg247 @Terry if you think about it, a sieg heil is just half of a dab

@chara @Jdogg247 @Terry Russia has Muslim protests take place in Moscow at staggering scales. Sure the people are more openly hostile to them, but considering no pogroms are being formed and Putin still visits the wall of Israel l don't see them as a viable option.Especially considering forming an opposition party is literally impossible. In the UK there are far-right parties. They never win, but with enough people moving there it would be possible to win districts.I'm not so black-pilled on the UK. I think the Brexit thing is going to allow discourse to shift further right and it will completely end the EU "refugee resettlement" - which is just Muslim redistribution.

@Terry @chara @Jdogg247 American Whites are the biggest cucks they'd never vote for anything to hurt poor brown people.You can talk to liberals and they will openly admit to ethnostates being superior in all social metrics if put in terms of Japan, Korea, or China.But mention that this is ideal for our societies and they start with: well these poor people, but "muh economy" would collapse, and "muh social programs"They fucking know, but they want to live easy in the suburbs and go into town to get "exotic foods" bc apparently the food is not the same with our brown sweat in it.

How does some dumbass Muslim chick make comments about the Jews and the bill/resolution now before Congress blames it on White Supremacists? This is so stupid:1BED9257-6CB9-4CAF-9E46-0B01DB8…

@Terry @chara @Jdogg247 We also have 14% Nigger and 22% Spic, among others; along with mass immigration from mostly #shitholes.If we were otherwise 98.5% European, yeh obviously we'd be better off.

@chara @Jdogg247 @Terry 4% as opposed to 23%; much easier to expel. Any Muslim in your country is a problem, but 4% can much more easily be managed than 23%.

@chara @Jdogg247 @Terry Migration is not a bad plan - Demographics is destiny. The Americas are lost.The UK is an island - easily defensible, culturally and historically close to the US, and has laws that can be used to eradicate opposition if a successful opposition party can take hold. It has a far better trading network than any of those countries mentioned, a state religion - which obviously just cow-tails to public opinion and thus very easy to infiltrate,  and doesn't have the Muslim problem of Russia (23% Muslim) and mounting an opposition party wouldn't be possible.

@benisnotreal @ArdanianRight @Terry Spics to Mexico, Africans to Africa, Commie to the Helicopters.

@ArdanianRight @Terry I refuse to vote for communism, but I also refuse to vote for the party that tossed me aside. While the discarding was not unexpected, it was disappointing, and I thought he'd accomplish at least one issue from his 2016 platform, not 0.Yang is a non-issue, and even if he get's there who cares. I am not voting for anyone who can't call for the White vote like they do the nigger vote, it's that simple. Once they realize they have to pander to us instead of assuming we are with them, as they do now, and promising gibs to everyone else except their constituency. Trump could have gotten the wall, he had momentum and Congress was unpopular. He could have blocked Paul Ryan's agenda until he got wall funding - Ryan and his cohorts needed that corporate welfare to pass to get set in their post-office gigs.

@zemichi @ArdanianRight @Cyph @ThreeOneThreeChris Yes, but think a little deeper, if Trump was successful at even a little of what he said, he wouldn't have an Asian taking his votes for saying the exact same thing as him. Plus one thousand dollars.

@Terry @Jdogg247 @ChristiJunior Fair point. But it's still possible with the right credentials and experience.I'd not rule it out. Easier to win demographics in a nation of 90mil than 400mil.

@PussySlayer @StarPrincess Fuck. I'd hate to live where you do.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior The downsides to Yang WAY OUTWEIGH the 1000bux.

@Terry @Jdogg247 @ChristiJunior The real meta plan is all aware Whites moving to England, staying low, forming a party, and using their oppressive laws to quash dissent while in power and form an ethnostate.Islands man, islands.

@DetectiveHyde @waifu ON WOMEN'S DAY? YOU BETTER FUCKING PLEASE HER YOU TEASE!

@PussySlayer @StarPrincess Import more muslims, you'll get good halal!

@ChristiJunior @SRSB Normally I think SRSB a contrite fag, but it's got a point.Humans all have ambition, it's just that aspect of our being is being used to divide the sexes rather than unite them.#EqualRights is still #Gay because #Equality is a #Lie

@ChristiJunior I like the idea (props to chara) of both them man and women working short hours - like 25-30 a week. And raising the kids jointly after school is out.Do we need 40+hour work weeks killing our men and keeping them from the children? It's not preferable for women either.

Kike Shapiro has been crying about Mudslime Omar for weeks now.I'll vote for every fucking Muslim if it makes the kikes so worried they forget to publish their anti-White horseshit.

@matrix >racism isn't naturalAll the racial slurs you hear at school are just not what they seem, I guess.Kid: "Y'all are fucking gypsies, man"Teacher: "You know, that person could be worse..."Kid: "Yeah, they could be black!"Xenophobia is what kept kids alive for hundreds of years. Someone you don't know is advancing? Leg it!

@matrix > Kids naturally want to shareGuess she never was on a playground

@igeljaeger @grips @matrix I'd go in politics if circumstances were slightly different. As it stands now, not likely I'm doing too well in the private sector, but if certain conditions are met I'd become motivated enough.

@igeljaeger @grips @matrix Is that such a bad thing really though?

@chara I think the best choice for aware Whites is to just sit out a cycle.Like if the fucker doesn't work for your interest, don't vote. It sends a message but doesn't give the mixed signal that fucking commies are OK.

@igeljaeger @grips @matrix It's on the far end of the left.Miscegination was, universal suffrage was, etc.Following the trend of liberal democracy their most extreme positions will be accepted eventually, so why not just fucking do it?

@matrix @cdmnky Last I checked I'm the only one here who brought in cake for my female coworkers!#Toxicity

@grips @matrix @igeljaeger The left always wins, so we might as well accelerate.They keep winning bc we do it incrementally and accomodate. Just go full throttle pedophilia, child hormone, communism and we'll have this done in a century.

@igeljaeger @IsaacWestcott @matrix Almost every country does that in times of need like war - even United States firmly controlled prices and wages and rationed goods during WWII. Almost half of USA GDP went towards war effort.Fun fact, one of the first things Hitler pulled off after appointment to Chancellor were crushing of trade unions and massive privatization - including banks and railways. That, naturally, slowly reversed with emerging war plans.

@igeljaeger @grips @matrix I'm fine with either in the right tbh

@comfy @ChristiJunior Can't we all just agree death penalty for both?

@igeljaeger @grips @matrix Our whole left-right dichotomy is fucked. There's no way you think that the right wing has an exclusive claim to freedom and liberty.

@igeljaeger @grips @matrix Everyone knows Socialism was tossed in because it was a fad term.Kind of like how neoconservatives pretend to be right wing.

@chara I'm kind of tired of the "at least he's not X mentality."Trump has shifted right wing politics back to maybe 1990s in terms of rhetoric, but only 2010 in terms of policy at best.I liked 2016 Trump, 2019 "muh holohoax" Trump pisses me off.

@igeljaeger @grips @matrix Nazis are in a weird category.

@PussySlayer @Secftblgirl 10AM?

> Gervais is correct. But evidence suggests that free speech no longer enjoys the cherished status it once did—in Europe or America. A new Gallup poll shows just one-third of U.S. students believe “hate speech” should be protected by the Constitution. It apparently has not occurred to these students that one can marginalize and suppress dissenting views simply by labeling them “hate speech.” Or perhaps that is the very point.> “We are miseducating a whole generation of future leaders on our college campuses today. We are teaching them intolerance, we’re encouraging shutting down dissenting views,” Dershowitz, a constitutional law professor, said during a recent roundtable discussion. “I am terrified about [what happens] twenty or thirty years from now, when these young people who have been taught not to tolerate diverse views become our leaders.”  https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/why-ricky-gervais-right-defend-free-speech-following-count-dankulas-hate-speech-conviction

@matrix I mean it was already messed up before that, which is evident in the tapesA good example is the one about a bathroom wall which needs repairs that nobody can agree on it's ownershipThis actually happens in real life all the time with train lines being owned by different companies and telecommunication lines being owned by different companiesThe nuance is there it's just only in tapes and shit

@p @dirb "She's fat and belligerent..."I'd just like to reiterate that point.

@judgedread They need to be ruthless. There is no need or time for nuance. That is my meaning.

@BugmanExtraordinaire That's a fair point. I can't think of any socialist country that hasn't been ganged up on or otherwise targeted for destruction.

@astheroth @orekix Wow. How anti-Semitic, to imply Jews are not victims.#GetGoolooged

@orekix @astheroth People wonder why I hate the US. You can only send your people to die in pointless wars and import vastly different peoples for so long before collapse.But at least Israel is safe!

@astheroth @orekix It's OK, they are all moving to the US. Our make soil will make them people.

@Zilya I love brown people.

@Zilya Your examples are retarded. Jews and socialists are fine. Those groups are secure AF.#BrownScare

@judgedread We need people willing to make such decisions now more than ever.

@orekix @shit @Zilya Can we just nuke the Americas?

@Zilya None of those groups are in danger.

@orekix I didn't/don't care either. The issue appears to be that degeneration begets degeneration. It's an endless slope leftward.What purpose could something like this possibly serve? What is it's ultimate conclusion?

@Zilya The guy on the left looks fine, just like a clean dude.The one of the right though...

@PussySlayer @p Toss in Jews and Zionists and you fix a lot of that problem.

@p Just so you're aware, I've not been advocating a change in your MO.

@p Kind of avoids the spirit of the question though.Say you have something that benefits you at the commie's expense. Do you cease? In terms of your server I understand your reasoning, but in general. Why not force commies to make their own platforms, like they force everyone else to do? Make them scrape by outside the mainstream.

@sjw Disgusting!

@benisnotrealNot nearly as bad, but I think the common ground here is: send the nogs back to Africa in shipping containers.Am I wrong? @chara @sjw

@p @sjwI agree with you there. My concern isn't to suppress the ideas, it's allowing commies have control over areas where speech occurs, whether it be tv, papers, school, socmed, etc.If a commie comes here we should shamelessly and ruthlessly troll them into submission. When I say "let talk" that's what I mean.@benisnotreal @chara

@rasterman We need to be geocultural, not geopolitical, and xenophobic. It won't solve all of our problems, but it may get the CivNats on board and acts as a good racial proxy. The culture will/should benefit us in the long run anyway over other groups.In this way nationalism is a bit backwards thinking - it fixates on tbe nation-state which is ultimately a political not a cultural construct.Sorry to get all meta on you - seeing Sargoy mentioned in your other post awoke my inner autist!

@sjw お休み

@chara First, obviously to any readers - or feds - I advocate only peaceful solutions and humble, kind, and civil discourse. Violence is never the answer, just do what Jesus would do and turn the other cheek! I would never harm any living being, even a fly or non-human, non-terrestrial alien.The "people" you described are not human. If you think of them as human they will win. By being unwilling to kill them yourself you are humanizing them. The leeches, degenerates, and worse will exploit this weakness to win - or at least destroy - as they have for centuries. I have 0, and I do mean 0, sympathy for these types of "people" you describe. However, I'm not dumb enough to go Bowers and throw my life away to get rid of some insignificant nobodies just so cowards who are unwilling to get their hands dirty - probably 90% of the population - can live a little more comfortably for a little longer.You must be nice, cordial, and kind, even to the out-group, but when it comes down to it you need be willing to eliminate without hesitation - even if they are friends. The moment you hesitate the enemy wins. The fact of the matter is humans are a herd animal. If you scare the herd it will stampede over you, but if you direct the herd it will crush your enemies.Nobody is going to stand up and organize all the "killers", as you put it, and save you or our people alone. Each and every one of us needs be willing to step up if the time comes and do our part. If Trump formed a Right Wing Death squad to take care of the commie issue, I'd join in a heart beat. When the state does it is not murder, it's extrajudicial execution and self-defense.Anyone who contributes to the decay and destruction of your people is effectively already attacking you, just because they are not CURRENTLY pointing a gun at your head doesn't mean you are not being attacked. Compounding with the fact that these people have previously been established to not be human, it really is more akin to pest control.

@chara You should ask nothing of others that you would not ask twice of yourself. If you are incapable of performing an action it is safe to assume countless more are like yourself. You are essentially asking to be saved. Speaking from a position of weakness is never the path forward. I'm not advocating you go do dumb shit, but say some filthy nigger millennial breaks into your home and aims to kill and rape your wife. You need to have it in you to fend off and possibly kill that sub-human animal!INB4: Niggers aren't humans. xD But by that logic neither are kikes - so you should be ready and willing if the time comes!

@chara @benisnotreal I thought you abhorred killing. You were all on about not fighting yesterday.Which is it? Is killing acceptable or not?

@p @Secftblgirl The people on the streets are as white as the winter sky during snowstorms! If that doesn't warm your heart nothing will!This "cold" is really just a elaborate defense mechanism made manifest in the MidWest.

Some of y'all have a legit unhealthy obsession with Gab. You talk about Gab more than Andrew Anglin talks about the fucking jews. Chill out. Grow some plants. Get a pet or a girlfriend.  Think about money, pussy or God. Just please for the love of all that is fucking good shut the fuck up about Gab and Andrew Torba for 5 minutes.

@judgedread Voting just complicates matters. What is the benefit of allowing a communist newspaper in any state? Can you think of any world in which you control the US, in which say "The New York Times" as it is is worthy of speech protection?@benisnotreal @p @sjw @matrix @Oblivia @PussySlayer @meowski

@chara @benisnotreal It's a good double standard. For instance, you can value life, but when it's "us vs them" always choose us.Somehow our people have been convinced double standards are bad, unless it benefits another group - then it's nuanced and complex - or in other words "Fake and Gay."

@sjw @p Yes, but is the double standard bad? The reason we are even having the crisis of free speech in the first place is because we allowed commies and other subversives to have free speech.They effectively used it as a battering ram to tear down all opposition to their ideas and attack people. Then once they attained power they started to shut down the very people who allowed them the courtesy of free speech.I understand your position, which is why I mentioned my exception in my "Rant Series", but broadly speaking, why let them speak freely or uninhibited? They don't, and it has been quite effective at maintaining power even whilst pushing vastly unpopular ideas for decades.@chara @benisnotreal

Female students rebel against transgender bathrooms, refuse to use same facilities with males.http://trump-train.com/2019/03/05/female-students-rebel-against-transgender-bathrooms-refuse-to-use-same-facilities-with-males/As far as the authorities were concerned, girls like Alexis would just have to get over themselves and perhaps get purged of their “transphobia.” We live in a new world now, and transgender activists are setting the agenda. Nobody is allowed to get in their way: Not parents, not scared teenage girls, not awkward and uncomfortable high school boys.

@melody What a bunch of #bigots!Men and women are the same anyway! DNA doesn't mean anything. It's all subjective, a (((social construct))) if you will.

@chara @benisnotreal It's a good double standard. For instance, you can value life, but when it's "us vs them" always choose us.Somehow our people have been convinced double standards are bad, unless it benefits another group - then it's nuanced and complex - or in other words "Fake and Gay."

@benisnotreal at this point, we shouldn't be even the slightest bit interested in convincing anyone of "free speech". the speech of the people we'd be trying to convince is already free anyway. really, we should be trying to convince people of OUR speech. and not just that, we should be trying to convince people of our speech at the exclusion of all other speech.

@chara Sure.

Rant 2: Fuck the Subversives; Free Speech for Some!We're in an strange situation with a rather ironic lesson. We are on a free speech platform, @p is pretty principled, and need to be able to speak to accomplish goals. However, the powers that be continually silence because it is counter to their narrative and threatens their power.The ironic part is that freespeech is what let these commies, Jews, etc. to attain power and spread their cancer. They know this so they aim to silence our speech. That's where one wonders: "Why did we ever allow them to speak in the first place?" and provided the ambiguous we - that is the dissident right at large - win "Should we allow freespeech?"My conclusion is "No." There can be places like this on the web, because I think in many ways it acts as a steam valve, but commies, Jews, and their ilk cannot be allowed to reemerge. The benefit of allowing small pockets to exist - that are relatively easy to access - is that it can be infiltrated by agents and misdirected. I'm convinced this whole "I DON'T WANT AN ECHO CHAMBER!" meme was started by a fed to keep dissident right people from uniting or forming a cohesive movement. Like 90% of our ideas ranging from @p to @chara, @sjw to @matrix - sorry to use you guys as an example - overlap in some way or another; but we are so convinced that because it's not 100% it'll never happen. To add to this the people who hardcore promote this "DON'T want an echochamber" are super vague and typically argue the importance of importance and often play "devil's advocate" on even unimportant issues.

"We just gotta convince the normie to see it's in his interest to have free speech"You will never accomplish this, the normie's ancestors had nothing to do with crafting the founding documents, or worked to overthrow it. There is no middle ground in that.

@benisnotreal free speech is overrated anyway. it has no inherent value in and of itself. free speech for what? free speech for who? for trannies and leftists and degenerates and their propaganda? no thanks. free speech is only valuable in so much as it's a tool - a means to an end. and right now, for us, it's not the right tool for the job.

The problem is that a lot of muslims support the terrorists and ideas.So basically, most muslims don't want to kill and aren't violent, but they wouldn't mind it, either.Let's take a look at some polls:TerrorismICM Poll: 20% of British Muslims sympathize with 7/7 bombers http://www.telegraph.co.uk/

@shmibs @awl It's not flattery, if anything I think it's incredibly limiting to think in the way you apparently do about this but the fact that there are people in the world who do so is completely necessary, yesI really don't see how I can elaborate any further on my position other than to possibly refer you to Big Mike's post about icelandic viking justice earlier in this threadThe only reason we think of non-state-sanctioned killing as ~murder~ is because we live in a state monopoly on violence. Icelandic society did not have that, so "vigilante justice" was the norm.

@DetectiveHyde @shmibs @awl Those types always piss me off in stories.They continue to live bc the violence commited by others, then condemn the defender.It's like telling a soldier to feel shame after he cleared a beach of invaders aiming to wipe out your village.People who are only capable of living via the violence of others are worthless.

@orekix @DetectiveHyde Enslaving was a mistake, the Portuguese did it right.

@wirelessguru1 Going to hell!?

@miya True. The ability to register them all and POTENTIALLY retroactively deport is pretty hilarious.If the world's future is global, best align with the East Asians and force the rest of the world into line. As long as we keep growing racial consciousness and produce faster we can out-compete and win against them in the future. Demographics is destiny ~ but at 7% of the world's pop from 34% just 80 years ago it's not on our side.

I don't think anyone appreciates that Yang's "support" for DREAMers is to offer them an EIGHTEEN YEAR citizenship path, giving ample time for any successor to overturn it and making them get registered and pay taxes on their work in the meantime - and deport anyone who doesn't sign up for it.Just read the language, the subtext projects visible disdain (asterisked for emphasis):- Provide a new tier of long-term permanent residency for anyone who has been here illegally for a substantial amount of time so that they can come *out of the shadows*...- This new tier would permit individuals to work and stay in the country, provided they pay *their taxes* and *don’t get convicted* of a felony.- This tier would put them on a longer, eighteen-year path to citizenship (*the same amount of time it takes those born in the US* to get full citizenship rights), reflecting our desire to bring them into our country but also *their decision to circumvent legal immigration channels.*- Invest heavily in an information campaign to inform immigrant communities of this new tier of residency, and *deport any undocumented immigrant who doesn’t proactively enroll in the program*This is about as hard-edged as you'd expect Trump to be, and definitely moreso than whatever cuck R would run against Yang. He's just framing whatever the fuck he wants in a libtard sounding way, throwing in some basic lip service to abortion and weed, and waving FREE GIBS in their face, and they're fucking eating it up.

@p @miya @ArdanianRight @Secftblgirl @judgedread @levi Collapsing the economy is a pretty straight shot at curtailing military spending. In fact, it's the only shot.

@chara @miya That's assuming it's a sustainable system. If the neet/incel/sperg/autist/millennial degenerates don't breed ~ we're done with them after a generation. In this way enabling their gaylord life style helps prevent the chances of them breeding even further. If I could give each nog 1000bux a month in exchange for ensuring that they don't produce the next generation of nogs I'd do it in a heartbeat!

You'll never see another White candidate on any major Dem ticket again, and the Republicans are trying to "diversify" as it is and likely won't win in the future otherwise since they refuse to embrace WI politics.

@aven I'm not going to answer a hypothetical someone poses towards me if they are using terms that they refuse to define.You've been tedious about what defines White, although in any other scenario you'd have no issue defining White. I'm Anglo, but according to you I may as well be Korean, or Swahili, maybe Russian? You ignore the Tibetan genocide, because I guess they are just standard chinks and may as well be Chinese to you; and perhaps more absurdly you can't even answer if a Black is Chinese or not.  You don't hire based on IQ in any field, you hire on expertise. I'd hire a 120 IQ civil engineer to design my bridge over a 150 IQ neurosurgeon. If you can't grasp a coherent concept - like race - I'm not going to yield any abstractions or more complex quantifiers - like IQ - in an argument.A company is very different than a country. You're treating a country like a company. Companies indeed hire on merit, however, the purpose of a state is supposed to be stability. IQ is but one factor, albeit an important one.I have an actual real world example for you: blacks vote 90%+ in favor of communist policies, hispanics/asians 70%+. Realistically, as their share of the population increases do you believe communism will be more or less inevitable? It doesn't take a genius to see the 0-sum game into which we've been foisted, even an ordinary person can follow such a simple trend if honest with one's self.

@aven 1/1Racism is alive in well within everyone EXCEPT Whites. Notably, we are the only demographic in decline and losing our nations across the globe. Anti-Whiteness working pretty well for the Dems. Note how they have stalled his entire agenda while out of power and got him to praise LITERALLY every demographic except the one that got him elected.As for multiparty systems, are you completely inept? In multiparty systems no single party holds power, it's coalition based.SoCal and the South West would easily host a strong Hispanic party, the South would have a strong black presence, and if you're any indication of the average White I assume you'd be voting for one of those - bc you're just above it all.

@aven 2/2White is those European ethnicity. I don't see fags like you deconstructing whitness as you're handing out affirmative action and praising based minorities. It's not a fucking hard concept. Are Africans black? I can't tell I usually confuse them for Chinese.Racial differences are good determinants of more than IQ, but to illustrate a point: there are more 115 IQ Whites than 100 IQ blacks and more 80 IQ blacks than 100 IQ Whites. Your atomized individualism is what is killing the West. Want to end Muslim Terror in the West? Keep Muslims out, no exceptions - 90% reduction immediately. Want to prevent Chinese spies in the intelligence community, don't hire Chinese in the intelligence community - similar effect. If you tackle everything case by case nothing will get done. You're effectively a liberal.Your hiring scenario is a total strawman and if you can't see that your IQ is below 100. 90% of the Republican voter base is White. Tell me in a room of 100 people with equal parts all races where will you find the Republican? Will you start with the blacks - who vote 90% commie - or the whites? If we can't apply basic heuristics to solve our problems our civilization is fucking finished.

@ffs @miya That explains a lot. Thanks dad.

@aven @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @diresock @judgedread Has the US secured the rights of Americans or constrained it?The latter is obviously true, and by importing a replacement population it is actively trying to redefine "American" to solidify the power grab.

@aven @judgedread @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @diresock MAGA was a lie. He'll amnesty the DREAMERS (Hispanic), give status to fleeing Venezuelans (Hispanic), and then invade them and watch us flood with Hispanics.Then it's full blown communism. Congrats. But remember, there definitely won't be any racial backlash, because we're all the same and they have the same worldview as us.

@aven Racism is alive and well.The Democrats are already built upon anti-Whiteness as their platform. If you think racially based parties won't spawn you're not paying attention.Mixing is nothing to be celebrated - at best it is net neutral, at worst entirely negative - and certainly not so widespread that race will be dissolved.If we transplant 40 million Hispanics to Japan over the course of 40 years will it still be Japan? Will it be different? Should they mix out? What about Tibet? I suppose the Han Chinese displacement of the Tibetans is a good thing. After all it's just a change in birthrates and mixing - which is good!

@aven I could support a hard right depending on how many of the current elite are carried over.Hoping for a multiparty system is effectively ceding this country to the invaders.You'll have the black party, hispanic party, white party, etc. It'll just be political ethnic conflict. The one advantage of the 2 party system was that the Dems kept them on the plantation. However, they started drinking their own kool-aid and imported too many if them.The 2 political paths seem to be either communism or a reactionary right. I know which I prefer.

@aven @wirelessguru1 @ChristiJunior @TrevorGoodchild If you accept tbe premise of one "-ism" you might as well accept them all.There is no such thing as equality by any metric and there certainly exists no system or person capable of exercising judgement free action.

@aven Universal healthcare and mass immigration too - forgot to mention those are right wing now.

@aven @matrix I guess time will tell. Considering that homosexuality is now a right wing issue it seems like we've come out further left, again.

@judgedread @Secftblgirl @p @levi Winning the culture war would see homosexuality opposed, immigration opposed, wars of aggression opposed, universal healthcare opposed, but instead the right - Trump included - is embracing all of it.We've gotten #Q "trust the plan", Richard Spencer alt-right, 200IQ Torba, and Alex Jones. Those are not the faces of winning, those are the faces of grift and insanity.There's a pretty strict time limit that we are fast approaching on the culture war; and the right has been losing heavily for a century and with the open embrace of the aforementioned issues this trend doesn't appear to be reversing under Trumpism.

@judgedread @Secftblgirl @p @levi You think Trump is the way forward? That he has some plan? That the GOP is on our side?Voting for a pacifier is poor strategy. I have no reason to believe he's anything but sincere in his #CivNat #ZOG ways.

@aven @matrix There's no reason to think they won't keep winning TBH.

@Secftblgirl @judgedread @p @levi Whites were more pissed under Obama than Trump.I see no reason the same wouldn't be true under Yang, and even if he accomplishes 1 of his insane goals it hurts the system.The issue with Trump is 2-fold (minus his disdain for whites):He's giving the illusion of victory while carrying out the status quoHe's a right wing candidate that is associated with disorder, not orderRight wing movements don't win on the promise of disorder and feeling like a winner while losing is ultimate defeat.

@judgedread @p @levi The covertness required for that is absurd and likely at minimum a decades long process - barring a strong rightward push.Do we really have decades? I see until the mid 2030s at best. Then it's Brazil or broke.

@judgedread @p @levi That's assuming you'll be allowed to build a platform. If Gab was run by a competent person with vision who threatened #BigTech it'd be targeted for destruction.Yang does support regulating #BigTech and breaking media monopolies. Even if his shit stinks, that's more than Trump is doing for us.Status Quo: a successful alt-tech is impossible. Until the media and big tech can be weakened there is no hope for platform building beyond things like the fediverse. This guy is attacking everything at once. In a classic red v blue scenario red needs only win once to succeed, blue needs to win 100%.

@TrevorGoodchild @judgedread @PussySlayer Like why there? Couldn't they have chosen a deep red area in the Deep South where they wouldn't just get instarekt? Or you know...anywhere in the MidWest?But no, let's do commieville.

@judgedread @p @levi Well what is? I don't see any "right-wing" politicians worth a damn.

@judgedread @p @levi That's the future the GOP are seeking. If it wasn't they'd not act as they do.Vote Yang and we may get there sooner, we may even crash the economy in the process. The sooner this fucking Frankenstein of a system dies the better!

@levisan Americans don't enjoy any free shit. Free anything. Nothing's free. Americans are America's Aphid farm.

@chara @Zilya You could buy a fleahlight or dildo for those twitch streams too!

@Zilya Are you saying you want the Jews to have money?

@chara @Zilya Whatabout: tax the Jews and burn the money? That seems like a fair compromise.

@chara @Zilya I wish I could vote for John McCain.

@p @orekix @levi @levi @meowski These vampires won't die out fast enough to reverse trends. Only chaos can give us the strongman #OrangeMan was supposed to be!

@p @judgedread @levi What if we just tax the rich Jews at 90% and give it to everyone else?That should make everyone happy. The Chinese want to be the new Jew anyway, at least the ching congs can't pretend to be huwhite.

@IsaacWestcott @levi @sjw So, like...The Vandals were right?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IrVUQjDSHY

@p @judgedread @levi Are you saying corporate welfare is somehow OK? But consumer welfare is NOT?

@p @orekix @levi @levi @meowski The lesson is long past. There is only destruction!

@p @levi @sjw Deep Space.

@p @judgedread @levi We give tax breaks to megacorps all the time. We spend hundreds of billions on wars yearly. This type of welfare has been "sustainable" for awhile.

@p @IsaacWestcott @orekix @levi @levi It's actually a diabolical genius plan.  Free money. Just dumb enough to work on this lazy dumb desperate population of parasites that would take the bait.We can't have welfare for the international mega corporations and bankers, endless wars, and free handouts for the slaves at the same time... something's gotta give here.

@p @orekix @levi @levi @meowski Let's assume they can get the benefits, same as everyone else and the controls suck. Collapse scenario imminent. If this place is to burn regardless, let them eat cake!The Republicans need to learn they cannot just keep trading social issues and demographics and keep winning. If they have to have their market economy destroyed to learn this lesson, so be it.The fact that their "model minorities" will be spearheading its destruction is all the sweeter.

@p @levi @sjw I'll be elsewhere. This is really a win-win-win for me.

@judgedread @Jdogg247 200 is like 1 in 4.5 billion. That retard is not 1 in 4.5 billion in terms of intelligence. He's a fucking dime-a-dozen 120 IQ AT BEST! I'm only saying that because he can clearly fool the fucking rubes.

@Jdogg247 @judgedread People keep saying this 200 number. Did he actually claim this or something?

@judgedread @Jdogg247 I'll have you know that Torba has an IQ measured to be within the high double digits!

@judgedread @p @levi I'm wary of directly encouraging birthrates via a blanket programs as you suggest (aka NS-esque policies), we don't have the demographics.Something like this will hep those already in stable relationships and get people to go on dates more often - forming the necessary relationships for child rearing.The lower class and those groups associated with it will likely waste it away anyway. I'd target working people, but letting our enemies die in comfort is a worthy compromise.Yeh...the budget says WTF: https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/

Imagine watching your people die out, the history of your civilization coming to a clownishly absurd end within your lifetime, you are hated by all, you are unwanted, unneeded by societybut then a chinese man sends you a check for $1000

@levi This is a good meme.

@mwvdragon @sjw Trump is #moe

@11112011 That's a hard sell. #ZOG loves giving people free shit, makes them accept endless wars.

​

@judgedread @p @levi If it is sustainable for a short time it could help birthrates.If we used funding from existing social programs it could last at least a short while.

@orekix @levi @levi @meowski @p His views on big tech are on point too. Trump can still win me over, but he's got a lot of work to do. Building the wall, limiting visas, and not bombing countries being among top priorities.

@orekix @levi @levi @meowski @p Like I've said, the minute the left ceases to demonize me and mine is the minute they are my friend.Chinaman or not nobody else gives a fuck. Trump has expressed more concern for ZOG and litetally everyone else. This guy can at least bring the problems Whites face to the mainstream.Worst case: all incentives for these people to come/stay go awayBest case: his shit works outEither of those are better than what anyone else is offering.

@levi @meowski @p @levi people that criticize Yang don't understand, Yang is supporting white people the highest, not only by incentivizing reproduction but by completely collapsing the economy thus stopping any incentive for immigrants to enter the US

@11112011 We dont need more curry-americans.

@11112011 Yeh...he's just going to import the workers here instead.

@weeb @orekix @p @wirelessguru1 btw the consequences of Yang losing are literally unthinkable

@p @orekix @levi If economic collapse doesn't wake White America up they don't deserve to live/maintain the country anyway.FIRE WILL CLEANSE THIS PLANE!

@orekix @levi @p Fuck everyone is that tense against Whites already, Whites just don't stand up in response.I got yelled at for wearing a suit in Chicago "Go home working cracka."Like WTF, my tax dollars feed you animals.I can only imagine how overt it will become when the gibs dry up.

@chara Marvel is #BigGayGo read old folklore and stop wasting your time on Jewish idols.

@p Don't rationalize with the plebs. FULL MEME AHEAD!

@p @orekix @levi If the Republicans refuse to represent their constituency and preserve our nation we may as well vote for the guy doing the same thing that wants to increase White birthrates.I'd sooner burn this nation to the ground than hand it over to invaders. I'll enjoy watching the cucks squirm as their free markets and Israel die.

@yolo @levi #CivicNationalism and #Multiculturalism (aka #MURIKA) in a nutshell.

@wirelessguru1 @Oblivia Your father raped you as a child.

@Oblivia No, my views are just objectively superior. But I will not force my superiority onto you, that would make me a supremacist.

@ObliviaThat was all. I can't make you drink my kool-aid, only give it to you.

@Oblivia @judgedread I always enjoy it. We drink beer, shoot guns, cook good eats, etc.I'm just saying, we degraded from larger clans, to extended families, to the nuclear family, to the single parent household.Obviously there is a hierarchy of importance: father/brother > grandfather > uncle/cousin (and the female equivalents)But without that connection to even your extended family there is no hopes of true community building - which goes beyond even your extended family.

@Oblivia @judgedread Our family is pretty connected. We gather about 40-50 people for the major holidays: Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Aside from that there's other stuff, but more persona, family holiday stuff.A big issue is many people seem content to not keep in contact with their family, immediate or otherwise. I think of my grandparents, uncles/aunts, and cousins as immediate family. I mean, your parents grew up with these people, why shouldn't you keep contact? That alone is a solid 15-24 people, not counting the spouses of your aunts/uncles which effectively doubles that.The destruction of the family unit is why #Q persists. There is no way entire families are dumb enough to believe in #Q!I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THIS!

@Oblivia @judgedread Family is a special circumstance. You can be more overt, more rude, and more aggressive with your views.I go way over with them than I do with anyone else, and typically it works on moving them to some extent.

@DetectiveHyde @Azurolu Only Jews and Shills don't. It just makes you #human.

@igeljaeger @rasterman @1w4kvra I wouldn't say all groups are voluntary. Your family is not - excluding marriage. Your nationality for the most part is not. Those 2 are the biggest group influences on your life.Family, should at least, be a positive experience, and you should want the social fabric of your nation to renain stable.Even if you live as an introvert interacting with 2-3 people what goes on outside your house affects you.It's not like you can live a nice, peaceful life in a crime ridden slum. These types are environments are minimized via multiple factors.You're an individual, but you're not an atomized entity that's entirely separate or independent of society. You cannot 100% choose all of your affiliations; your taxes - which are involuntarily collected - are proof enough of that.

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @IsaacWestcott Unless you're that one last Neanderthal man looking at the sunset from the mountains of Atapuerca, you have a group of your own. You only act as if you don't. It's a learned behaviour. Westerners are professionals at it, having practised since they were young.Also, the picture didn't load.

@igeljaeger Incelcuck I oscillate between love/hate with you.I think I'll settle for roughly pounding that ass. You'll like it ;)

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman Doesn't sound like that when you go on your Pole kvetching.

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @IsaacWestcott No, seriously. Hypocrisy is only bad when applied to the other side. And that, in itself is hypocritical. The point is, stop thinking being hypocritical is a bad thing.The in-group first. To hell with everybody else unless is convenient to the in-group.

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman Doesn't matter. Having to breed like a rabbit to keep your country is fucked.Housing is super cheap and kids will be able to afford to move out. Population ebbs and flows, it self corrects. No need to import mass outsiders.

@igeljaeger @rasterman @1w4kvra Incelcuck thinks White countries bad, but homogeneous other countries good. Because the mean German did bad touch in 20th century.Japan good bc anime, West bad bc no anime.

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @IsaacWestcott Lefty progressives have it right in that one regard, at least. Apply the rules only to the other side. Not to yours. :trollface:

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman The economy is on the way down the toilet as we speak. These "diverse" peoples that you love are net takers.You're just being a fag now, so I'm done with you.

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman What do you mean?

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman How long until they can do it to your kids? In NY you can't sue a doctor for performing an abortion without your consent if he deemed it necessary - so there is precedent.In the US we all have to pay extra for groceries so food can be made kosher. It's a sign of cultural dominance. Ceding every issue isn't a sign of strength, it's a sign of stupidity.

@igeljaeger @rasterman @1w4kvra You should care. Just a small number in the US have brought female circumsion into our discourse and it's fully legal now. We'll see where that goes.Soon enough they will start restricting where you can buy bacon.

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman You're just strengthen my main point: Fuck 'Em.

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman I don't blame you, wtf has Germany done for you? Brings in a replacement pop and tells you to fuck off. Same for the US. If it wants to blame me for all ills - and I'm not even get healthcare like you - it can fuck right off.I'll go be a tax slave elsewhere.

@1w4kvra @igeljaeger @rasterman Or...leave them the fuck alone and just close borders?Why does no one just consider closing borders to anywhere outside the West bloc? It's not likecwe don't have that right/powet.

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman Exactly. Tbe vidya game and drug industry.I told you fags it was brilliant!

@igeljaeger @1w4kvra @rasterman Nuke Berlin, then kebab is removed from Germany.

@rasterman @1w4kvra @p @jack You could get maybe...3% of Whites to support.It's going to take time to rebuild ethnocentrism. So go knock some bitch up and get a professional network.Got to Jew the shit out of the Jew!

@1w4kvra @rasterman The problematic part is the US could maintain a semblance of control until it reaches a breaking point from which it cannot recover and will balkanize/erupt into conflict. Up umtil that point, life cam be pretty sweet - then suck real fast.Those less able to maintain the illusion of peace, sure the power structures mat collapse, but the nation likely won't be as irreparably fucked.The US imported too many serfs and them treated then like people - now we get to deal with the consequences wrought by decades of stupidity.

@p @rasterman @1w4kvra @jack I'm telling you soft population control is best. You can target demographics you wish to diminish, while also targeting the less desirable of your own. Nobody is going to support open ethnic cleansing unless a civil conflict erupts - which would be #bigGay.The only reason the blacks in the US stabalized is because the Dems started drinking their own kool-aid and actually started giving shit to them, but never bothered to dismantle the systems that were intending to harm them in the first place.

@1w4kvra @rasterman He's not American. But I get your point. Issue being: the US is in a way under a Psycho-Pass lite system.Expose yourself as not a corporatist or multiculti cultist and your life is over - it's not so bad yet, but the witch-hunt (aka brown scare) grows every year.

@ThreeOneThreeChris GenXers do often seem overtly black pilled. They lived through the transformation and did nothing to stop it, now many of their children are feeding that system.It's pretty sad, honestly. But hey, unpleasant solutions still exist! And they are solutions none the less!

@IsaacWestcott @p @jack @orekix @rin I agree. Whites are already a global minority and despite the fruitfulness of our race we are in the danger of extinction. Partially it's because the semitic race that is seeking to undermine us but partially it's our own fault since we have a seemingly subconscious death wish. In Israel all the branches of the Jewish race are treated equally and so we too need to stop being blinded by petty flag waving and kosher patriotism.

Everyone is just so focused on "things" and the middle and upper classes insulated against consequences.In what way do you think it'd affect my view of unironic Nazis? I don't see myself as one, but I do see them as a potentially aligned faction (provided they aren't 100% #LARP - in which case they are irrelevant).

@orekix Measuring economic success via population growth is a retarded metric. This is true even if the muds were "contributing."You're right, our politicians are fucking cucks. Literally none of them are worth a vote. As to your solution - already on it. But people shouldn't have to breed like rabbits just to maintain their own countries. That's demographic warfare of levels the world need not see. However, it may already be too late to avoid.

@orekix I also think half the left's issue with idpol is that they have too many conflicting groups.The blacks, gays, spics, muslims, abcde groups all want something different.

@chara Israel at 95. Those high IQ Jews.

@orekix White identity politics need not be Nazi. I hate that it always gets compared to that.Is it so much to want your own nation, uninvaded by other people at impossible to assimilate numbers? The more this position is painted as "white supremacist" the worse the solutions that present themselves.

@torts Or not allowing SJW-commies who seem preoccupied with killing white people. That would probably stop people from becoming "nazis" in the first place.

@wowaname another option to avoid worrying about hate speech is not allowing nazis to stick around

@wirelessguru1 Is the "girl" on the left your mother? What a cutie.

@torts @wowaname Because that's how you get a hellthread.

@jack @judgedread @ThreeOneThreeChris @p @Secftblgirl @11112011 @comfy @Jdogg247 @Oblivia @rasterman @lolocaustianity @Benisnotreal @ArdanianRight Can't tell if sarcasm. I get the not trusting everything the powers that be tell you, but this is a bit absurd.

There a bunch of fags on here who run if you mention "race" in a context that's not #PC approved.Either tell me to fuck off, like a man, or kys. Easy choices bb.

@JesusChrist You skipped supper time.

@orekix I too take issue with its foreign policy, however, I don't think it needs to have its core population mocked, destroyed, and displaced as is happening now.There is no reason the West should be expected to first open its borders to mass immigration and then treat these people as if they and their ancestors built these countries. We are expected to cede ever more and more of our society to these outsiders at every level. Many of them hate or are ignorant of our history, and make no effort to hide their disdain every election cycle.The minute they stop demonizing me is the minute I work with them. Until then we need to counter them using the very methods they are employing.

@orekix I still don't understand why you view immigration control and white countries as supremacist in nature.

@orekix @DJWalnut @wowaname It's both. I don't like the empire, nor do I like their hostile, imported replacement population.We don't need hostile outsiders to save us. That's like introducing a predator into your home to take care of a pest only to have the predator become a new pest.

@igeljaeger I love you 2 incelcuck! <3

@orekix @DJWalnut Not playing their game has been failing. Why let them have a weapon/tool that you can't use?Also, do you consider just White nations existing White supremacy? Why should we have to host endless hordes?Is every homogeneous nation "supremacist"?

@orekix @wowaname @DJWalnut You're saying the constant demonization and displacement of the majority at every level of society doesn't merit a reaction?Regardless your view on identity politics, your view of social justice is communism.Fuck communism and fuck just rolling over and accepting the damage these people have inflicted on our nations.

@wowaname @DJWalnut @orekix All I want is to deport brown people and execute communists.Maybe when the left finally kills our current "right" that'll happen.Cheers to a bloody fucking future, because the left doesn't know how to back the fuck off and let people be.

@wirelessguru1 @wowaname @DJWalnut @orekix Good luck with that inspiring truth, milord.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya I've never been left of right of center. My family was a little further than right of center during my childhood, the difference between me and then was that they conformed their views to society as it shifted left. They accepted the changes, wheras I refused and thus went further right.If you're shifting right you must realize there is something wrong happening in our society. It's good you're not going the NPC route of the AR and jumping on the easiest target (the Jews - I mean fuck Jews, but they are just a piece at this point).Keep exploring, if you're honest and earnest I've no doubt you'll move further right.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya You're an example of a low functioning...leftist? Alt-righter?

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya Then watch porn. Anyone who advocates celibacy/no masterbation is a fucking retard.You can assume most of what they say is retarded and that all thought doesn't go beyond base level.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya Issue is 46% of Jews are 1%ers and if you look behind all of the policies you hate; you'll find Jews or Israel (also Jews).There are treasonous Whites as well, but they don't represent most Whites, wheras the data tells you that the Elite Jews do represent most Jews.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya You can't fix the West via compromise, yes. You're not going to stop the degeneration without being explicitly against their policies in all forms.You can either admit defeat and leave, or fight against their premise. Right-Wing NPCs exist as vote fodder. The important thing with them is to remove the thought that "-isms" are bad.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya Explicate.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya Accepting 1 premise is the first step towards accepting their next.You won't stop their continual leftward pushes via compromise. They view you as bigoted, hateful, backwards, etc. Your view is illegitimate. They'll push further right when you accept even an inch.It's been happening for at least the past 100 years, if not longer.

@IsaacWestcott @1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya Tranny feels or free expression - pick one.I choose freedom.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya #EdgelordBut it's a start.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya I'm no advocate of fag/tranny death squads. More importantly, I am against giving them special rights. Marriage should be church only, fuck a legal contract. Homosexuality and Transsexualism are mental abnormalities. Treat them as such. If they can function and conform, sweet. If not, that sucks. Don't go telling the schizophrenic that the voices are real. Similarily, dont tell the tranny he is a woman.

@Oblivia @judgedread @Jdogg247 @rasterman @Terry @PussySlayer You have to be 1337 to get a checkmark.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya Agreed. Break up the banks! Destroy the fed!

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya Illegals shoyld be treated like invaders and criminals.If caught crossing: shot dead.If caught inside: deport and register its identity, if 3rd offense; execute.If injured, but illegal same process. No treatment, just GTFO. Start enforcing our borders and the flow will begin to diminish.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya You won't be able to if you accept the left's various -isms are bad.

@ArdanianRight @1iceloops123 @ChristiJunior @miya You're definitely an adherent to Liberalism, which entails both liberals and conservatives. If anything you were a left-leaning libertarian.Like you just said: you've yet to break the hyper-individualist mentality. I'm not for becoming a drone, but you can't fight alone.I'm pretty certain you think fags and trannies should be accepted too.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya What's the source if that issue though? Regulations. It's not like you can just make a new paypal, and even if you do the credit cards can shut you out. Now that you can't make easily - because REGULATIONS.The entire payment processor issue: banks can apply pressure behind the scenes and force action on part of places like paypal.

@1iceloops123 @ChristiJunior @miya @ArdanianRight Centrism is the lack of a stance. It means you just accept the mainstream, which is leftism.You say you're a centrist, but rewind 20 years with the same views and you'd be considered a leftist.Centrism just goes with the flow, the flow is leftward.

@1iceloops123 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @miya I'd say biggest thing is breaking up monopolies: tech, weapons, banks. Monopolies are not free market. Our regulations are anti-competition, they make it impossible for new competition to emerge and keep the megacorps secure.

@1iceloops123 @ChristiJunior @miya I'm glad you're moving Right, but don't bring your leftist shit with you. That's why I sperg at @ArdanianRight sometimes.You guys were clearly liberals until recently. You have a sense of hyper-individualism which causes you to ignore the dangers of accepting leftist premises.The old saying "if you're not a liberal when you're young you don't have a heart, but if you're not a conservative when your old you don't have a brain" exemplifies this perfectly.You bought into the shit, because you're young and stupid (idealistic), then as you age you hear shit that sounds crazy to you, so you begin to function as a "conservative." Problem is your conserving the leftist ideas of your youth! This cycle has to stop!

@judgedread @11112011 Sometimes I do wish you were God-Emperor. At the very least I wouldn't be bored, and at best the commies would be hanging from trees.

@1iceloops123 @ChristiJunior @miya A worthless hypothetical. If we are at that point, we've already lost. Better to reject this communist horseshit before the GOOGLOGS are formed.As for me I'm a fucking WHITE MALE. That's crime enough to be guilty forever regardless what I say.

@1iceloops123 @miya If we could ensure everyone is a net contributor, sure.I don't see why we can't hijack healthcare. Just promise it to all families with a WORKING parent, same with education (up through primary).

@1iceloops123 @ChristiJunior @miya Yes. Because that's how you stop a disease, you play with it.No. You attack it. Don't accept their premises, it legitimizes their views and makes it appear acceptable - it becomes mainstream regardless political affiliation.If someone calls you a racist, homophobe, bigot, etc. don't argue against it. Just say they are a fucking idiot and your policy speaks for itself. Don't defend, it implies their insult is relevant and lets them derail.

@1iceloops123 @miya Shouldn't we first:a) deport all illegalsb) revoke all visa where an American can fill the jobc) revoke all non-english speaking immigrants statusd) deport all anchor babies, their chain migrants; and revoke their citizenshipBefore we talk about bringing more people in? Shouldn't we prevent further erosion before piling more dirt onto our mound?

@IsaacWestcott @1iceloops123 @miya Bottom line: If you're too uncomfortable with being called racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, pedophobic etc to stand up to the Left's bullshit, you'll keep giving ground to them and remain on the Defensive. Just look at how insane things have already gotten - saying that boys have penises and girls have vaginas is now pretty much considered Hate Speech!

@1iceloops123 @miya Most of the libertarian movement has been hijacked by faggots like you.You don't stop "progress" by accepting the left's premises thinking that they'll ever be satisfied.

@1iceloops123 The wall isn't a full solution. We need to SEVERELY limit legal immigration too.You fucking idiots act like losing a country legally is not only OK, but an acceptable outcome.Fuck illegals, but fuck more legals too.

@1iceloops123 @miya You sound like a gay alt-righter. You're a #MAGAPEDE #NPC.You can't even contest that you're just a fucking leftist who ran to Trump because the changes you thought you wanted are scary, so you'll trade social issues thinking Papa Trump's wall, which will not be built, is going to save you.

@xeno @Epsiloco @Olivia Alt-Right is #BigGay. But caging your dick is self-cucking. Regardless relationship status, bro.

@1iceloops123 @miya I knew it. You're yesterday's liberal. This is how society keeps moving left.People like you think you're so enlightened, that what you view as "individual liberties" are the be all and end all - no need to go further. So you ignore hard social issues, just say "as long as it's not in my house" as if what goes around in the space outside your house doesn't matter.In 10 years will you be defending pedophilia, trans-species, open borders? If not, by accepting these current leftist premises you are setting the stage fir them to force their next agenda.

@ChristiJunior @miya @1iceloops123 The Alt-Right absorbed too many cretins and is pretty much dead. Basically it's #BigGayThere is a nebulous dissident right, which includes many factions, but no networking that allows it to challenge the mainstream.

@xeno @Olivia @Epsiloco That's reaching dangerous levels of cuckoldery.

@1iceloops123 @miya Let me guess: you're pro-fag and pro-tranny?

@ScottALavender Just like we're riding towards curtailing the alien invasion and not a mass amnesty, right.

@judgedread @onewaydotcom @Oblivia Who cares of they think their are influencing culture. The point is they are active, as far as the masses are concerned that's all that matters - stress and activity. The mongs aren't going to drive change. There is no grass roots, populist movement waiting. You know that or you wouldn't advocate for alt-tech as you do. Yes, the masses need to be ready, but the change is going to need to come from the upper middle and upper classes. Those of us up there cannot currently express dissenting opinions for reasons we all know already.As long as what they are doing gradually aligns with us, that's all that matters. If this Dissenter program gets them used to annotators, plugins, and more decentralized communication; worthless program or not something has been accomplished.Can you imagine using bots on something like the dissenter to promote views or insights on news for these people? Just have it give them a perspective on a story that pushes them towards our views could be useful. They exist to be vote fodder and noise makers, nothing else.

Coal mines are where White people become niggers.#ChangeMyMind

@judgedread @onewaydotcom @Oblivia There could be a trending or popular sites module, or possible filters to limit by site.I don't see annotators as tools for the masses, but ways to communicate information within a specific community.No alternative #SocMed is going to match Twitter or FB. But there's no reason these models need be the end all.This is already a new model, and while it certainly has its flaws it is pretty good.

@chara @miya It's hard to stay poor. Stop buying lotto tickets, beer, ciggs, and fucking cable. Just go to work and do something useful in free time, like spending it with your family.

@chara @miya Catholic school from K-Grad. Only fags and spics think things are free.

@chara makes sense. there's an ownership and permanence aspect too. renting apartments pushes them to live temporary in the moment existences, which translates to empty hedonism and distraction, loyal undifficult consumerists.

@chara @miya I think our family backgrounds are a little different. xD

@chara @miya My parents and grandparents went to college. You can get your college paid for if you're a brown mongrel, but as a White man? That's 40k out of pocket. That's why I worked first, because I was gonna be damned if I pay interest for the fucking muds to get it for free.If my parents were better at being racists maybe we'd not have the issue.

@chara @miya Depends on the family. My grandparents were super successful, but my parents generation lost the family businesses.I'd not have lost them as they did, that's certain.

@chara @miya I've was an asst director before I was 26 if that counts. :)

@judgedread @onewaydotcom @Oblivia Most people won't get fediverse. I think it starts with people who use things like fediverse and goes from there.10 years ago old people didn't use facebook. It appears to be about just getting a stable community and going from there.I won't use Dissenter, but I don't diss the concept. My years in academia may be skewing my view on this a bit, but I like the concept.

@chara @miya What if shitty housing is just a means of encouraging people to stay at work instead of relaxing?

@judgedread @onewaydotcom @Oblivia If used for a focused purpose just having the plugin installed and the reviews/whatever appear as you do basic surfing instead of having to use a gay centralised media platform allows for more freedom.If I could just visit something like NVIDIA and see your comments on cards w/o making a post asking about it, or legacyOS with recommendations on which phone is good, without explicitly posting about it that's nice.I think it could fit the decentralised model nicely.

@chara @miya What about the 3B/2B, living room, dining room, kitchen, study apartments with a roof garden and balcony?That's basically a suburban house on a roof.

@judgedread @onewaydotcom @Oblivia If a true "alt-tech" ever forms such a program could be useful for writing reviews, providing context, and such for the alt-tech community.I think when focused for a small group's purposes it has potential. But that's not Gab's directive.

@judgedread @onewaydotcom @Oblivia Maybe it's because Google is #BigGay and deep down nobody trusts them?Small groups of researchers use web annotation...but maybe it'll never move beyond that.

@chara @miya That's a terrible image.

It's not like one can go entirely off the grid, but certainly you could lose phones, pc, etc.But you'd be at such a disadvantage that all of your otherwise free time would become consumed by menial tasks. Like sending a letter instead of an email.

@MilquetoastQT Honestly, cooking is generally better. But you do what you got to do.The "abriged" summary looks like it's more though. xD

@aven @matrix They can speak, but giving them an audience - as educators at that - is foolish.We can say "muh principles" all we want, but clearly one they gain power they will just lock you out as is happening now.Why should we extend our enemies a courtesy they will never give us? Has giving them free speech thus far hindered them in anyway? It appears to have helped them a lot.Communist ideas are now mainstream, their influence over culture way too strong, and their policies ever approaching realization. Fuck commies, and fuck enabling them.

@sjw @MKULTRAdiamond @11112011 @Oblivia @WIR @p FUCK! I'M A BOOMER!

YOU FUCKING BRAINLETS, the reason "Sci fi" and "fantasy" are interlinked is because they are both SPECULATIVE FICTION, meaning they are about hypothetical worlds, or hypothetical states of OUR world, that aren't the BORING FLUORIDATED MESS we seem to be living in.The only reason people think of "typical fantasy" and "typical Sci fi" is because unimaginative, unoriginal writers can little more than ape Tolkien or Wells or Roddenberry or whoever.Magic is real. Science is real. Heroism is real. Skullduggery is real. Gods are real. Demons are real. Aliens are real. Psychics are real. These concepts are all related to the imaginative mind because they all represent something more INTERESTING.That's why Haruhi Suzumiya shoves them all indiscriminately into her more interesting world.People do have preferences. Personally I'm getting sick of "What a twist! Your D&D party was in a data centre all along!!" (Directed by M. Night Shamalayan), good fiction is still coherent and clever, but I'm sick of the EUPHORIC distinction between the existence of the unexplainable and *buuuurp* science Morty.Shmibs, if you're reading this and no longer mad about dicks, I expect an impassioned defense of sad lit fic about black and white boys who are too existentially tortured to hold you. We can make out after.

@matrix Once he indocrinates enough people he will have been responsible. Giving this guy access to kids is sick.There is literally 0 reason to let commies hold positions of authority. It is the most toxic ideology, even worse than Islam.

@nepfag @luckyp3616 I just saw this. What is unlisted?

@matrix Well, if they are commies you do.I do not operate on the parameters of "there are worse."If there is a murderer on the loose he can't be tolerated because a worse one exists.All communists are mass murderer enablers. The only good commie is a dead commie.

@sjw I could down that way too easily. What a dangerous drink.

@lynnesbian Those are a lot of words for someone that I'm just gonna call a "fag."

i've seen a lot of these terms used in porn, and some of them even used innocently, so i'd like to make a list of terms that most of us won't like.obviously, i don't speak for all trans women, let alone all the people who would be personally offended by these terms. some of them might not offend others, and i might miss some.with that being said, unless you've been told by the person you're referring to that it's okay, NEVER refer to us as:- he, (s)he, "she", it, he/she- shemale, ladyboy, dickgirl- tgirl (in a vacuum, this is just an abbreviation of "trans girl", which is fine, but the connotations and context it carries make it very bad)- tranny- chick with a dick- ___ with a surprise/something extra/a party trick/a trick up her sleeve- trap (we're not "trapping" people into having sex with us...)- futa, herm, hermaphrodite, gender bender- "the best of both worlds"- faggot/sissythose are some of the worst ones. i'd also recommend that you don't say:- "transgender" as a noun (i'm not a transgender, just like your fridge isn't a cold)- (born/trapped) in (a man's/the wrong/a male) body- male to female (this one is more accepted than the other ones on this list, but many, including myself, don't like it. just say "trans woman" or something.)- "you're so brave for choosing to do this" (we don't have a choice. we didn't bravely choose to be trans. many of us see being called "brave" as belittling.)- "when's the surgery?" (calling it "the surgery" implies that it's something of extreme importance, a rite of passage we must all go through to truly be trans. it's not. many of us don't even want "the surgery". i'd recommend you call it "SRS" or "GRS" instead, if you must refer to it, but don't ask people about what surgery they're having)- "what were you born as?"so what can you say, then?- first, think: is the fact that i'm trans relevant here? it really only matters in a few circumstances. your friends at a dinner party don't need to know. just as you wouldn't say "cis woman" unless it was relevant, you needn't say "trans woman" unless it's relevant. but if you're sure it's relevant:- trans woman, trans girl (binary people)- transfemme, non-binary girl, enby (non-binary people)if you absolutely *MUST* disclose the sex originally printed on our birth certificates (and this should rarely ever happen. one of the few examples is talking to a surgeon.), then say "AMAB", or "assigned male at birth".why are there so many terms we can't use?- many of these terms have highly sexualised connotations- some of them insinuate that we're "actually" (or "used to be") male- some of them were invented with the explicit intent to be slurs- being trans is something that's quite hard to understand, and there's a lot of nuance to itif you have any questions about why some of these are bad, reply to this post and i'll do my best to explain. please act in good faith.

@PussySlayer @jack Imagine we have something like hypothe.is/dissenter.We could markup news articles, tech stuff (vid cards, phones, etc.), videos, all that jazz.We could limit users to our community in a multitude of ways: whether it be linked to the fediverse, or just req registration with approval from a mod/admin.This concept has potential. I hate to see Gab ruin it! I wouldn't discount the potential of something like this. I'd seriously check out both these before you write off the concept. This is something that can be useful to a small group. If it somehow catches on all the better if a free source independent of #BigTech can be made available.

@PussySlayer @jack Exactly. The problem is not the concept, the problem is Gab.

@PussySlayer @jack You downloaded the Gab Dissenter? Call me retarded, but I like the concept. It's kind of like hypothes.is - which is useful.The problem with the plugin isn't that this type of connectivity within a community is bad - imagine if we had like an internal site review app/plugin that wouldn't be publicly available it'd be nifty.The problem with it is that it is Gab.

@jack I don't see people connecting this to ZOG. Although I hope they do.

@IsaacWestcott This connects with people because it is an easier thing to get to the bottom of. Migration is one of THEIR 3-level mind fucks. 1. ZOG destroys a noncompliant vassal state.2. Altruism calls for help for the displaced.3. Resource-sensitive natives react to invaders. Few people can step back and see that whole picture. Whereas people can easily react to art they personally make or like being suddenly categorized as a serious sex crime.

@jack So you think it is a big deal? It's not really a reemergence though, it's been around. It's not like loli/shota is new.How exactly is it a big deal? I see so many more important issues, but this thing is going off like a bomb in my feed. Maybe that just says something about me - who I follow - but I seriously which this energy had been directed at the UN migration faggotry, our mass immigration issues and pointless wars, etc.

@DetectiveHyde You fucking #bigot! I'm going to have the authorities check if you got a #licence to be acting like that!

@jack I don't really see anything for the Jews to gain from this and as such wouldn't attribute it to them. If you want to say it's (((Abrahamic morality))) - fair enough...but that's pretty indirect.TBH, I'm kind of surprised and annoyed at the outrage around it. Yeh it's dumb but the UN is doing so many worse things. Like we aren't going to discuss replacement migration? Communist "green" initiatives. South Asian death squads?I don't advocate censorship, but it's just fucking porn.  Seriously if half this fucking energy was directed towards bigger issues they'd be in the process of being fixed now.

@vamp898 @matrix Many leftists are fundamentally good people, but misguided. You are not one of those people.Please travel in a muslim slum alone at night. Goodbye.

@vamp898 @matrix That's absolutely retarded. Now it's just generational guilt? You don't even wish for a better world, you just operate on spite!Should the Germans gas themselves? Should the Jews nail themselves to a cross? Should the Portuguese starve themselves? The Hutus cut off their own legs?YES. I have seen what happens when an invasion is not stopped, only a fool wishes it upon themselves.You are not a good intentioned individual, you don't care about hatred, or violence, you just want people to suffer because of actions of the past.You literally just proved @matrix correct. You're a control freak commie who feels guilt for the past.

@vamp898 @WIR @matrix If your country turned into Turkey within 50 years you'd be pretty pissed - and rightly so.You become alien when mass demographic shifts force your entire system to bend to their will. There is nothing wrong with small DIGESTIBLE immigration. But these rates are too much - they have to go back.

@vamp898 @matrix Your social justice will be your own undoing.That is not even analogous. A board game is not life, an experiment where the rules are LITERALLY stacked against you is not reality. "Ethnics" as you put it, proportionally get way for financial assistance than us - from housing to schooling. If anything they are paying less.They commit far more crimes against us and themselves. Example: Blacks commit 10x the amount of violence against Whites that we do vs them; and more than 5x that towards each other. They hold themselves back.You egalitarian view is flawed. I'm not calling for oppression, I'm calling for a system that doesn't actively work against its own people at the behest of those with no history or concern for the systems we've built.

@matrix @WIR @proxeus @vamp898 There are a lot of theories on that. I don't really care about the motivations of a past failed political order.I'm concerned with the future, and I don't want to become alien in my own country, nor do I want my family or community to suffer the hardships of dispossession. I want my people to have their place. I do enjoy visiting elsewhere, but I like to return home and have it not be a mixed mess.

@vamp898 @matrix It has nothing to do with that, strawman more. In the American Midwest, where the population is mostly white, there are almost zero 'hate groups'. In the American South where the non-white population is near or over 50%, 'hate groups' proliferate and racism is stronger than ever in history.The anecdotal evidence is hard to refute...people who live among their own kind are less likely to hate outsiders which they never interact with. Why would someone hate something they never see? Do you hate nitrogen or smog more?

@ZettaiRyouiki A fine butt!

@vamp898 @matrix Look, you're not the US yet demographically. Nor should you desire that. It's not surprising a large city grows faster than rural areas in a developed nation, that is a common trend.I think that it is pretty common more traditionalists are from areas with less foreigners. The reasons are more complicated than just "obviously these browns are good and the rubes are just bigots." It seems harmless when there are a few, maybe even beneficial, you get cool food, new music, etc. But the increasing disenfranchisement doesn't stop, they keep voting for more benefits at your expense. It becomes a source which the state WILL use to increase power and stomp dissent.Your invaders are even worse than ours. Crime has increased in your country and in response your police are militarizing, just like ours in response.It can happen fast, the US has gone from 87% European to 61% in just 50 years. Don't become the US.

@vamp898Child pornography is censored, because the only way to make it is to rape a child. There's a demonstrable harm. Hate speech is free speech. There's no demonstrable harm from hate speech, thus there's no good reason to censor it.@proxeus

@vamp898 @proxeus @matrix You live in a literal unpolluted ethnostate. Invite tens of million Muslims, Indians, and Blacks into your country then tell me how happy you are.

@JapanAnon @rambeaucockius2 @luckyp3616 https://youtu.be/6UpMwVfwoDA

@jack I'm rejected every day. But if 1 out if 100 says yes, I still got a fucking YES!

@nik @jack That's the thing. Trans are inherently unstable because it is a mental abnormality. I mean that as no offense to you, it's just what it is: a condition.If we pretend that trans are fully functional individuals we will have to start make future concessions to other illnesses.The reason I am not as harsh as many on the Right in regards to trans - similar with gays - is because I think it can be bred out and many can lead relatively productive lives, PROVIDED we don't warp society to their specifications.If it were up to me I'd go so far as being willing to cover part the cost of transitioning in exchange for sterilization. If removed from the gene pool and made relatively productive I don't see much an issue.Moving forward we need society to start focusing on the abled, not the disabled. It doesn't mean they need be brutalized, but this focus on fringe or unproductive groups and victimhood needs to end.If we keep it up it will end poorly for all of us. Our current civilization is in no state to resist Islam, Chinese imperialism, or even internal net negatives groups.

@nik @jack By normalizing I mean openly accepting trans-sex as a functional, appropriate life style. I think there should be some stigma to it, like other mentally ill people.If I become schizophrenic I don't want to be trusted with a gun or power over others. Much like I don't want to see trans trusted in situations where lives, health, and other such things are on the line.

@nik @jackI understand treating it as a pre-existing condition, because it is. However, I understand if the insurance will not cover it anyway that it may not make sense in some POV.That being said for the sake of not normalizing the condition I'd rather it be ignored entirely: ie not prexisting, but nothing covered.The fact that you do only HRT confuses me more than just "transitioning" TBH. I'm no medical expert - on this specific topic, but I do have experience with transfolk - I've read lithium and more of your natural hormone (whatever you are naturally) tends to help. In the case of my only living trans acquaintance this did help. He's a little...duller? But definitely happy and functional - although we are no longer friends.

@nik @jack I'm glad yours worked out, but I'd like to point out you were clearly better prepared as you tried other methods first - which is what I stress.Politically, I agree these politicians are total #fags. I dislike how "marginalized groups" are often defined. But let's set that aside.We disagree on anti-discrimination. Legislation in this regard never really prevents discrimination, it just shifts it. As far as public services if you pay taxes you're owed the service. But healthcare? Do you mean forcing insurance/state to pay for transitioning? That is probably a chief issue for many.I will also say that I am wary of further normalizing trans-sex in general. We are always told the slippery slope isn't real...but the 21st century has really blown that narrative out if the water.

@nik @jack Since I've seen you be civil in the past, if you don't mind me asking: what do you think of the politicization of people like you? Do you want special laws or for people like you to just be free to scrape by like everyone else?

@nik @jack Obligatory questions. I know it differs, but did it help? Do you feel like you've just conformed? Did you lose anyone?I've known more trans people than I care to admit, I'm a magnet for crazy. Take as much or as little offense as you want from that statement.

@cant_into @Elfie @yolo @hanny @BugmanExtraordinaire I beg to differ. It could help you identify shit vs chocolate. Situationally your sense of smell can be quite useful for a analytic purposes.

@Dolus @ChristiJunior @Elfie @hanny @yolo No. Aside from the hottest women on the world part, I've been in that situation and refused.

@Elfie @hanny @IsaacWestcott @yolo "If the trans is attractive that means the heterosexual man perceives the subject as female"You can arrange 3 pounds of Shit to look like a chocolate cake and people might at first glance think it's the real deal, but upon closer inspection they will react with disgust as the truth dawns on them. Doesn't mean those people were coprophiliacs."Transwomen" are polished turds at best, even in the rare cases where the outside initially seems appealing, what lurks beneath the surface is appalling.

@Elfie @ChristiJunior @hanny @yolo Interesting discussion. However, I'd like to point out that it all began by you, for lack of a better term, #WhiteKnighting for a trans-sexual; who evidently cares little to assist.おしまい

@diresock TL;DR ((( #Democracy ))) #SucksThese issues probably won't be able to be solved ((( #Democratically ))). However, that's where the conflict must first be brought to light.

@judgedread I indulge crazy too often, I'll admit it.

@Elfie @hanny @yolo No. You're trying to legislate it. I want no laws regarding it.It is a hill worth dying on because a society that fails to protect its people is god awful and feeding a mental illness is about the worst fucking thing a person can do.

@IsaacWestcott @EchoSierraTwo @diresock (cont.) there'd be no government-provided welfare. welfare would be a function of the communities (as it was for thousands and thousands of years before). if someone was seriously in need, they should expect their family and friends and neighbors to help them out, instead of getting cut some fucking niggergoidal neetcel check from the feds.

@ChristiJunior @Elfie @hanny @yolo First, don't use the word gender, use sex. You know better. :0330: Second, I don't even want trannies to be miserable. I just want them to seek help and other avenues before mutilating thenselves. I don't want kids being pumped with hormones and I don't want every little degeneracy and mental illnes being codified and given special status.Schizophrenia runs in my family. If I ever get it I don't want people to tell me that the voices are real.

@ChristiJunior @Elfie @hanny @yolo Men are #fags.

@chara @diresock @EchoSierraTwo I dunno. I'd pay burger flippers ~$7 or so, and depending on the worjer more or lesd.If I had a steller cashier/flipper I could justify a little more. But if they suck and I need 2 people to do what the good guy does alone I could see less.Thing is, without minimum wage you can negotiate. All these set pay levels make you stuck making the same regardless skill/work ethic.

@chara @diresock @EchoSierraTwo It really does make people think they'll never move beyond base capabilities. Upper/Middle class folk support it bc they "feel so bad" which is a terrible basis for policy.

@Elfie @hanny @yolo You can't legislate fairness, because equality is a myth. No 2 people are the same. People have different capabilities and aptitudes. Enforcing "equality" will end in state tyranny and communism.Legally endorsing and protecting literally unlimited "orientations" is impossible and insane. Society is not to conform to any little whim. There are 2 sexes, everything else is useless.

@diresock The system is currently working counter to this. Import the 3rd world, become the 3rd world.We have to start heading off issues before they are unavoidable. Our current system is contributing to the problems.

@chara @diresock @EchoSierraTwo Fast food work should be what part-timer parents or kids on break do, not a career.We wouldn't have this issue if we weren't importing endless cheap labor for otherwise sustainable jobs.

@diresock Standards of living is quite subjective. I also don't see raising the standards of living for shitholers and their disapora as a worthy cause or particularly worthy goal.Globally it may have risen, but not within our own nations - where it has decreased. This is because we use these (((profits))) and spread the wealth globally. Globohomo communism is definitely a thing, and our current system is feeding it.

@Elfie @hanny @yolo If that's your meaning I don't disagree. If people who "pass" as you say and are truly dedicated to their delusion want to use another bathroom, I don't think it's hurting anyone.The issue is they've moved beyond that. It's inclusion in sports, media, bathrooms, etc. It's pushes for special legal status, special social status, etc. If we stick to the SEX binary and nobody demands the system change for them I have no issue. Basically, legally, academically, professionally, etc. you are treated as your REAL sex, not your fantasy.Although I do advice mental/psychological counseling first. Stats don't lie, it's oft suicide regardless and I've had people in my life go that route.

@diresock Confusing/bad wording, but I'll explain what I mean.The regulations passed in the US are not done to hurt big business, they are done to hurt small business.When you need a team of 200 lawyers costing you millions every year to become involved in key industries you kind of eliminate any possibility for competition.As seen with the big banks, this allows them to flaunt certain laws, rake in profit, crash and socialize their losses at the expense of the public.These "regulations" make things more expensive for the company to operate, but they don't make it any less profitable. In fact it becomes more profitable because there is no competition.

@orekix @EchoSierraTwo @diresock Unregulated capitalism has clearly not worked out.We're in the process of selling the rope to the communists as we speak.

@diresock The worst part is, the other side is really no better.Conservatives: We need to increase the White birth rate.Also conservatives: There's nothing wrong with our economic system that allows muh private companies to kick employees to the curb whenever they want.  Unemployment and welfare are ebil communism.  McDonald's is always hiring, stop being a lazy leech.  Fast food workers don't deserve a living wage, raising the minimum wage is ebil communism.  You shouldn't have gotten married and had children in the first place if you you can't afford to support them, stop being irresponsible.

@chara @diresock I don't know if you can base an economic system off a finite resource. Now a social system...maybe :1011:

@Elfie @hanny @yolo Can they receive women's business loans? What about minority hiring and women's scholarships?

@Elfie @hanny @yolo Really? So men who are pretending to be wonen should be in female sports, lockers, bathrooms, be ineligible for draft, etc?

@chris You brought Jews up, I was being polite and relating them in the preparation example for your benefit.Blacks take way more from this system than they give. They comit 56% of gun crimes and 52% of violent crime. They are basically the sole reason police are becoming increasingly militarized and inner cities are such shitholes. The environments they create here so closely mirror the ones they create in Africa snd elsewhere. They are not 1st world people. White Knight.

@chris There are limits to which a system can support a dependent population. If Whites starting getting assistance at the rates Blacks do this country would go bankrupt within a very short time frame.From your talk I take it you're a socialist. Because if not you're effectively a socialist. The more non-White this country becomes the faster we spiral towards socialism. It's evident based on the numbers and increasingly the faces of those pushing more radical communist ideals.

@Elfie @hanny @yolo Even if I were to cede that point, which I don't, you didn't refute the reality.What you said wasn't clever. DNA isn't something you can just dismiss. Your genetics are not elective. Surgery will not make you functionally the opposite sex.

Theres this weird feminist dude in my campus ranting about porn being bad bc we gotta respect whamenNow im getting the full university experience, my tuition now feels completely justified

@IsaacWestcott one thing you said is true: Jim Crow era African Americans will never "get over" slavery and Jews from around the world will never "get over" the Holocaust.And a few will always be guilty of playing those atrocities like a Stradivarius.The native American Indians have always sucked at that. Indigenous people around the world generally have sucked at it. There will never be anything like reparations. Anything close to it.Oy vey!

@chris We are already paying reparations - welfare, section8, aid to Israel, wars for Israel, etc. Anything more is just icing on the cake for them.The goal should be to stop this endless guilt based communism from growing further and going a step further, eliminating it.The Left knows to target their opponent's base whether by dilution or otherwise, the Right doesn't. That's where we need to change.

@chris @Kelly_NAproducR Sweet. Here's a pocky. :7230:

@chris That in no way relates to anything being discussed nor does it refute the point.

@chris They vote 90% Democrat consistently. They don't give a fuck about traditional America, it will always be racist and bigoted in their eyes. "America was never great." - Booker put to words what they think.African and Black are synonymous. Race is a coherent concept, no one is going to wake up and identify Donald Trump as black - no matter how many black power fists he makes. Nor are they going to vote for him.You're literally parroting leftist vernacular.

@Jdogg247 Can we send them to his native #Israel since they are so #based?

@nimblejack the self-proclaimed "progressive" west's approach to east-asian (especially Japanese) culture in general tends to be extremely racist, another example was a bunch of americans protesting a museum for letting people wear kimonos because "cultural appropriation" (because to them, the only culture that can be spread and shared is white culture, because they're white supremacists)

@animeirl @nimblejack Gay take.

@chris They, as in the blacks.

@anna @hanny @yolo I've never been to a #4chan, #fag.Are you denying that your DNA will not change and is immutable?Are you denying trans suicide statistics?Seriously how fucking stupid can you be? Also, #programmingSocks are cool.

@chris I don't understand your response. It didn't really address the question nor the issue.

@hanny @yolo Your entire ideology is based on delusion. Even if you chop your dick off, make a little hole there, implant boobs, and wear a dress you're still a male.Your DNA hasn't changed, your body will naturally produce testosterone, your health inclinations will remain male, and even if you had a more feminine bone structure any marrow/fossilized DNA found in the future will prove you to be male.You're still statistically just as likely to kill yourself after "transitioning" as well. Seek help. You are suffering a mental illness, you weren't born in the wrong body, you were born with an imbalanced psyche.

@ChristiJunior "Ok. Fine don't draft them, but don't pretend they are equal then.No draft, no vote. All the rights and none of the responsibilities." ---this is what you're thinking---In our current system you're not wrong, but there is a 3rd path -- eliminate the draft.Why should any of us fight for its #ZOG wars? We shouldn't be sending our men OR women to die in pointless wars anyway.

@orekix Things tend to divide along ethnic/racial lines. Korean Catholics are a fine example. They may follow much the same doctrine as Catholics and otherwise coordinate/coexist, but it is theirs.I assume Shinto would/could be the same. Every group adapts beliefs to fit their group, culture, and world view.

atheists are so gullible, they mainly fight abrahamism but just replace everything with materialism, there are other ways of spirituality besides (((abrahamism))

@orekix White Shinto when?

@sarchasm @judgedread I think people are so terrified of alleged "echo chambers" forming they tend to seek groups where ideas differ so wildly that no new idea becomes refined.The mainstream is a left echo chamber, we are always exposef. I simply don't see a need to talk seriously with leftists or centrists.The former because they are an anathema to me and my ideals and the latter for being just NPC variants of the former.I'll debate a Nazi, Libertarian, AnCap, etc. But only because we mostly agree on issues, just not solutions.

@sarchasm @judgedread Do you really need leftists in your virtual life?Just turn on any news station or talk to some normie, hell just watch TV. The mainstream is saturated in progressive BS, why actively seek it elsewhere?

@orekix @tuxcrafting If you're going to blame Germans for everything at least reference the invasions of Rome.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Ricky Vaughn is a #fag. But if he saw the #Jew as a beatable enemy and just ceding an entire arena to the enemy as foolish at least he had one thing right.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire I don't see an insult in what I've said, I see a criticism. I do, however, see you called me a parrot to delegitimatize. I've also seen you criticize people for reading "(((philosophy)))" as you put it, then recommend me to take heed of a philosopher. If anything is Talmudic, it is that. You literally see Jews as invincible. You've built them up to be something that they are not.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire You're doing exactly that. Your plan is to live underground and int he shadows like an animal. You have no fighting chance if you refuse to fight.When demographics tends turn the military from 78% White to 78% mud, do you think they will not use it against us?Do you think when we are South African demographics things magically get better? Because that's all your plan is.Jews did not form America, they did not spur the colonies, they did not have a hundreds year old master plan to use us to enslave a continent. They didn't orchestrate Hitler to revolt so they could form the EU and bring Europe to submission. They didn't begin modern medicine, they didn't even start banking.They are a subversive people who found us at a weak point, exploited our faulty ideological premises, grounded in Liberalism, and have used it to exploit us.Those are not the actions of an unstoppable people, it is the actions of a scared people desperately trying to control something bigger than them.-- Read Nietzsche? Doesn't that go against your ideals of not believing in "book smarts" or trusting the words of man? --

Tip of the Day:Jews are not gods, they are rodents. Don't place them on a pedestal.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire There you go putting the Jew up on a pedestal again. Jews are not gods.The black pill is strong in you. I think we'll have to agree to disagree, your Jew worship sickens me.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Yes, I am leaving. I'd rather everyone here not be fucked regardless. I also have family here, so it's not like I want them to suffer. Leaving it physically does not remove me fully from the situation. Only a selfish asshole abandons his family.It is easy for me to thrive within the ZOG system, I could probably even reach the C-Suite someday; but currently I am seeking a different path. I am not ready to accept that taint on my soul, so I am seeking alternative paths and maybe I'll be able to get some of my family to join me on my exodus.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Ceding all power without resistance is foolish. Small isolated groups are easy to take out. You could form your little enclave and all would go to hell around you and you'd not survive. It's not like because you withdraw everything to going to collapse nicely and you can pick up the pieces.Even if it fails, failed political actions hold more potential than doing absolutely nothing and letting everyone think it's hunky-doory until they are fucked.If you attempt to isolate yourself from the system, you will be crushed. There is no forming perfectly isolated, self-sufficient communities here anymore. They'll either find a way to diversify your community or keep you as tax slaves. You'll have no say because you will have no stop gaps of your own.You have built up the Jew to be some invincible other worldly demon. They are just a small number of ethnocentric rodents that most people are unaware of, and those that are aware either think them invincible or otherwise unbeatable. Their power is based on falsehood, attack the false narrative and speak what is true and it is possible to win. It will be dirty, it will not have a perfect end, and it will be annoying. But it will be infinitely better than running off into the woods and praying to some Aryan god and hoping magical psychic powers bring us unto deliverance.

@benisnotreal @BugmanExtraordinaire @ChristiJunior @jack The Republicans biggest mistake was allowing themselves to be perceived as pro-White while not actually being pro-White.It has essentially scared away the anti-White block (non-Whites) and forced the party to have to spout quasi-nationalist rhetoric which just encourages pro-Whites to organize and emerge from the shadows. Identity politics has wrecked this country, but we won't fix it by ignoring its existence and leaving it only to our enemies.

They would create the same weaknesses within our society and this time we would be surrounded by, possible multiple, hostile fractal states.

@jack @ChristiJunior @BugmanExtraordinaire @benisnotreal The benefit for taking the Republicans is that nobody likes their stances. They are far easier to dislodge than the Democrats. The Democrats have plenty of internal struggles, so there is not point in not vying for power within the Republicans.Like you said, letting them be is possibly more dangerous than the Democrats. However, with the current state of the Left they will be free to do their worst and not help us in anyway.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Under increasingly (((globalism))) and globalization, that is impossible. Most will still shop Wal-Mart or Amazon over a local shop just to save a couple bucks.Organizations like the Yakuza have had literal centuries within a homogeneous, non-hostile environment. We do not have the same luxury.That being said, I am not opposed to starting regionally, in fact I believe that to be the most effective means of supporting national solutions. Let's assume Trump is sincere, where will he derive support? None of the main Republican apparatus supports him, no governors, no senators, no house reps (except maybe Steve King), nobody - at least openly.We need regional power structures to properly coordinate on a larger scale.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @ChristiJunior @benisnotreal @jack Ending "apartheid" was not an internal decision. The good old ZOG had a lot of say in that decision. The entire international community came down on them.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack I do not suggest a race war or terrorism, but I do suggest winning our people over with whatever message will work, even if it means ceding certain economic matters. We don't need 90% of Whites, we need maybe 2/3 to support our positions broadly for electoral success and an even smaller number to actually execute favorable policies.Deporting all illegals and hunting for (((communists))) and (((subversives))) is very likely a winning strategy if phrased correctly. People are afraid and confused RIGHT NOW! That is the exact environment needed in order to push people into drastic solutions. Trust in the MSM, academia, and the current governmental institutions is waning, a strong man clearing house could get enough popular support.Many of the south western states may very well flaunt federal law more than they already are provided the right conditions. If someone like Trump could purge the main administrative apparatus and appoint more like minded generals and other administrative leaders bringing these places to heel and under martial law could be possible.Lincoln did far more because of far less, Sherman executed total war on rebelling states. The precedents are there, the apparatus just isn't ready.We will have an age advantage for another 20 years or so. So many Hispanics are yet children and blacks are confined to small areas, and Zionism is under attack on all fronts not establishment. After that we just need favorable policies to reverse demographic trends internally and prevent further non-White immigration.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack If their influence is as strong as you say then there is no peaceful solution, period. The browns hate us as is, as do the Jews. If you are unwilling to confront your enemies you lose, plain and simple.What is detrimental is willing to accept vast losses just because it is easy. Hitler's approach failed, so it doesn't really matter. No Hitler or Hitler like solution will ever present itself in the US.Don't you see "accepting reality" - as you put it - and normalizing the existence of these people into our society is just a win for Liberalism? You just justify their existence merely because they are here. That leads to their coexistence with us ad infinitum. The reality is:A) These people are political enemies.B) The Left understands the way to deal with political enemies is to dilute and diminish their demographic.C) We need to do the same.There are a multitude of ways to accomplish this, "peaceful coexistence" - which is paramount to letting these animals continue their rampage in our country -  is not a solution. It's just letting them run free to "own the Jews or something."

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire You've just said "it will work itself out." That is not really explaining.

@m4iler @yolo @p It's for file organization, retard. Do you want your files sorting by month? If your sort like this it is:A) Easier to search with scriptsB) Sorted by correct date by your computer.If you do option 1 something in February 2001 will show as more recent than something from March 2017.Option 2 is option 1 on extra dumb.

@p @m4iler @yolo MM-DD-YYYY is cancer.DD-MM-YYYY is retarded.YYYY-MM-DD is correct.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire The Jews knowingly import toxic invaders, and your solution is to accept them?They are all parasites, and it is best to deal with them as such. They were imported with the knowledge that they would become detriments to society, you don't just accept an enemy's Trojan horse with a smile.You're not going to win over the imported muds to defeat ZOG. Our own identity politics will be needed, if using our current system, and we might as well tackle both at once. They are already aligned, so treat them as such.

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Can't I not want both?

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire So are you saying projected 2040 demographics will be peachy?

@matrix What test is this?

@MKULTRAdiamondhttps://www.soundboard.com/sb/solrosin

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire It doesn't sound good.

@xeno @igeljaeger Every human is born with the right to call anyone a nigger.

@matrix I'm afraid to see the others now...lol

@matrix What the hell? I thought that last thing was a 1 off. How the fuck are there more if these?

@kyzh @animeirl Niggers don't belong in politics, or even a first world country.Bernie isn't White, he's a Jew you anti-Semite.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack They have a unifying force beyond that: Islam. While it is fractured it is still a core ideology by which they can agree to remove the Jew first.We have no such thing in the US. You can say the Jew, but that is in our view, so many are willfully blind or following it for the promise of power.

@DetectiveHyde @BugmanExtraordinaire Yeah, it's a sword of Damocles, a standing threat, because we're all prisoners in a resource farming system. Someone should write a straightforward book for autists about how to larp as civiliZOGtion men. I've discovered a few tips through trial and error. The first I learned by working at one of these petty bureaucracies. When someone says no, hang up and call back until you get someone else on the phone. The interoffice politics means that people are fighting for status roles such as the hardass, the maverick, the efficient one, etc. Sell the problem to the right one of them and it will get done even if it's against the rules. Another one I've been testing out is laughing. These people have cocooned themselves in petty authority, but they are very insecure. They feel more powerful when you cry because you need the permit to get the appointment and the appointment to get the permit. When you reaction instead is to laugh at these sorts of embarrassing inefficiencies, they feel very insecure, and most seem to be willing to break any rule so they can prove to themselves (and to you) that they still wield power. That's all I've come up with, because I'm not the best person to assemble such a list of psychological tricks. It should really be a non-autist.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack That's what we need to fight for. This is why I hate Hezzbollah LARP talk.You tell yourselves that "it's not gonna happen" use it as an excuse to do nothing, collect guns, and wait for collapse THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN until we are beyond fucked.Infiltrating/creating corporations is likely the way to go. Ethnocorpratism. Because the odds of most Whites supporting Hezbollah like activity, even after a collapse is slim.Probably at least 50% of Whites are never going to amount to anything other than a walking, atomized economic unit. We need leaders, not masses or terrorists.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack Hezbollah is a stupid strategy. It is only likely to work SHEERLY because the rest of the ME is still demographically the same.NA is not in a comparable situation.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack I don't want 1950, I want a 2050 where we realize shitholers aren't our people and physically remove them by any means necessary.

@IsaacWestcott @jack @BugmanExtraordinaire You're 100% right. The entire thing is a fucking joke.You know what we've illustrated here?"When it comes to who we allow into our (((states))), economics take precident over both love and culture."

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack The US is already 40% non-White GENEROUSLY, Canada has gone from 92% to 72% in 10 years and has near US level (((immigration))).The enemy is within the gates, a wall is not changing that.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack Exactly. They are surviving. We should aim to prevent ourselves from reaching the point in which that becomes our best option.Only an idiot actively pursues a post-collapse tactic before an actual collapse. If all the nuts who did that started getting involved in local politics and networked we could aim to weaken/dismantle ZOG before that.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @jack The difference being: they have neighbors with friendly demographics when ZOG falls.We don't have that in NA. Canada and the US are surrounded by hostiles.

@DetectiveHyde @jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Meanwhile, the hordes get in for free and the state pays lawyers to do their paperwork, bc they can't be expected to know the language.I know an Englishmen going through a similar situation to yours in America.His wife is trying to organize the paperwork while he works full-time.Luckily, he made certain to get a BSA loan to start a business beforehand and is making bank - bc the US business loans favor immigrants/foreigners for (((reasons))).

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Don't forget the deliberately ambiguous elements designed to add a discretion element to law.For example: my American wife, immigrating here to England to be with me, had to go through a lengthy procedure of visa application and approval. But the criteria were always left deliberately ambiguous. Missing information, missing requirements. Only in cross referencing lists from the actual government website, state AND private immigration lawyers, and the citizen's advice bureau was I able to get the whole picture. (E.g. - A special category of home inspection is required but not listed on the actual website checklist. There is no set procedure to apply for one. It differs by local council.)Another example is that we had to show that we had a "genuine relationship" and had "made wedding plans." Try as I might, I could find no actual criteria. In the end we submitted a bundle of love letters, photos together, and even some chat logs from our long courtship, which thankfully proved to be enough. But at the time we were too poor to plan a big wedding around a date that we MIGHT GET DECLINED FOR. Thankfully, having a registry office reservation proved to be enough - BUT I HAD TO BEG A CLERK TO BREAK THE RULES TO EVEN GET ONE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BOOK ONE UNTIL YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PERMIT THIS WAS ALL IN AID OF.Do you see? Law is not a stabilising force. Law is not there to provide fair rules. Law is there to act as an ambitious sword of Damocles, a threat, an imminent judgement that could come at any time. Its name is Tyranny.Tfw stuck having to LARP as Civilization-man and can't just be Culture-man (yet)

@yolo @xeno He already took your shoes, huh?

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Lebanon's parliament is mandated 33% Jewish. I can only imagine how much more they control via bribes and extortion. Every Israeli I've known has liked Lebanon, so they probably aren't any real threat and likely already a fucking puppet.Both countries barely exist and only do through constant warfare and are bombed regularly.You can't possibly call a future like that ideal. Sure, they do what they can but don't glorify them. They are what  losing a slow, war of attrition looks like.

@yolo @xeno How did you even have a pic for that?

@jack @BugmanExtraordinaire Ok. But what has Hezbollah accomplished?

@KoopaTV @forte @ArdanianRight Yeah, that's a shame. Don't worry, I'll fix it:@p, we need a button to edit our posts, along with a history of previous editions so you can't unsay things, but have an option to fix typos.

@igeljaeger @h @wowaname @yolo @rainydaynaptime Spain is core western. I meant the language, but if I said Castillian you probably wouldn't have understood.Yes, Spain has economic issues to deal with, but the kind of individual that partakes in this kind of linguistic suicide is unconcerned with fixing the economy. Generally what they think would fix the economy boils down to "tax/expropiate the wealthy" "raise minimum wage" and "muh paygap". People smart enough to understand nation-level economics are also smart enough to consider the idea of butchering a language that has been almost unchanged for 500 years for the sake of someone's unstable feelings ridiculous. This also applies to the Spanish diaspora and western civilization in general.

@orekix @Oblivia @PussySlayer @StarPrincess I misread his post, which is why I was confused and deleted it.But my thought was say your instance admin wants to stop being associated/maintaining an instance and cannot delete it.In such an event the users could still post via the instance and it would be un-moderated. If illegal content is being posted and not policed - who would they go after in this situation? That was my question.

@PussySlayer @1w4kvra @judgedread @StarPrincess @ArdanianRight There's a stream that was done by Baked Alaska co-hosting Andy Warski where Laura Loomer had a chat with Metokur about that whole incident, after the video, I think, because she was pre-butthurt with him. That stream is legendary. Never before had I seen a normie like Warski go from "I'm 12 and what is this" to "gradually I began to hate them" during the course of the conversation. Loomer acted like a stereotype out of Mein Kampf and as she kept getting caught, she kept lying. If you haven't watched it, please look it up. I'm sure one of the archivist guys has it somewhere.

@IsaacWestcott @miya 4. the machine will always make its art for the love of the art (or at least, for the "learning experience" of the art). the machine's art will always have soul in it ("machine soul").

@chara @miya Most importantly you acknowledge the machine's spirit.

@Cyph @PussySlayer @StarPrincess @meowski @Secftblgirl #Listen here #zoomer #faggot. Back in #MyDay we called em #poundsigns. Now #metoo.

@chara @miya Hitler made some good art. I'm not certain if his intent was to sell, but honestly it was still fucking beautiful.

@chara @miya There are a lot of struggling artists in cities, that will oddly take pretty much any commision for cheap.I know of 1 in a city not far from me where people sell arts for ~$100-200. It varies in quality, but there are still a fair amount naturalist/realist artists out there.My parents got a portrait of the woods for like $400. Considering that was probably their weekly income, they were willing to toss something else in for an additional $50.All in all that's not too expensive.

@chara @miya I have some artist friends, so I be lucky.

@DetectiveHyde There is a gaming company going by that moniker now. I wonder if they are commies.

Sometimes their phone numbers too. There was etiquette then. People like Kaniini could not WAIT to destroy it.

@DetectiveHyde I hope you get it published. Or at least release it on the net for us weebs to read.

@chara @miya I too praise the machine.

High Realisations™ while watching Did You Know Gaming with Alice and eating dinner:1. Most gods are little bitches. You should never listen to any god or demon or whatever that is like "ah yes......... submit to me human......... be my little bitch.......... haha I am the god of making you do shit........", you should print off pictures of them from the (((goetia))) or whatever and cum on them. Fuck you.In short, religion is actually usually for little bitches, and I say this as a paganAmaterasu is cool tho 👌2. The writing in Pokemon games is the weak point. All the lolis are nuttable-to and shit, the monster designs are cute, the core gameplay is addictive, but all the stories are like "ah yes....... every THOUSAND years.... i am free......... now it's time to take revenge on The Scientists™....... who were traitors all along.... (unpredictable plot twist here guys)..... oh no... it is the primordial DIMENSION WARPING pokemon... it will turn your smash stage upside down!!!!!!"3. The Empire in TES is actually kinda cool from a certain perspective, even though I usually shit talk it. Comparing "The Pocket Guide To The Empire: First Edition" (which came as a physical feelie with copies of TES: Redguard back in the day) with the "Third Edition" (which came as a physical feelie with the special edition of Oblivion", there are some fun differences.Basically, the First Edition was written in the days of Tiber Septim, the emperor who would later become (part of) Talos. It's propaganda to appease him, largely, but it starts with an invocation of the Eight Divines (no Talos yet, remember?) and the "Sixteen Acceptable Blasphemies", dedications to the Daedric Princes, written backwards.The Third Edition was written millennia later in the days of Uriel Septim VII, the emperor played by Patrick Stewart in Oblivion.  This one lacks the "Acceptable Blasphemies", showing that the Empire has gravitated towards worshipping the lawful, comatose, saint-like Aedra ("Divines") as opposed to the chaotic, lucid, capricious Daedra.It also includes the Ninth Divine, Talos, since it was written after Tiber Septim's apotheosis.The invocation of Talos reads as follows:"Come to me, TALOS, for without you, my Lord and Emperor springs from rootless dust, and the Empire is scattered before the winds of war and ignorance."This made me see Talos and the Empire in a new light. The "divinity" of Talos provides a divine imagined history (and it IS imagined) for Tiber Septim, giving the Empire itself a "divine origin." (If Karen is reading this, she's probably drawing the Shinto parallel right now. Hello Karen!)It's also emblematic of the idea that the Empire is a desperate attempt to impose law, "ordo" and understanding on the bizarre, chaotic and magical Tamriel.Obviously I don't like this much in many ways, being a card-carrying Argonian (ARGONIA FOR ARGONIANS, and that's not even racist since any race can become Argonian :33333) but I can definitely see how it was necessary to oppose the horrific antinatural hegemony of the (((Aldmeri Dominion))), as well as to just... keep things stable for the "little people", I guess. A sad story.

@IsaacWestcott @luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior Note that usually the genetics people I've read usually attribute most of what's not attributable to genetics to random developmental noise, so genetics is by far the biggest at least somewhat controllable factor. Malnutrition is relevant for development between the 1st and 3rd World, but evidence for it being relevant when discussing 1st World gaps is shaky at best.

@DetectiveHyde Your writings are 100% more entertaining than the sanctioned books.Ever considered writing fiction? I'd buy your shit!

@p @yolo @xeno You've revealed a new depth to the catboat meme. >I should buy a boat [before I :killdozer: ]. Much is said in what is unsaid as bottom text.buy-a-boat-cat-01-625x450.jpg

@ArdanianRight @luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior Genetics period.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior You're proposed solutions are no different than the solutions the Republicans have been failing with for decades. At some point we have to move beyond the pathology that limited government will become our saviour in an age of hostile megacorps.We need new solutions and new ideas, not to feebly attempt what keeps failing.Explain to me why 24% of the Dems electorate is more worthy than 40%? The Whites and Blacks are there for different reasons: gibs and justice respectively.Justice is abstract and can be redefined, gibs are concrete and demand payment. Where should we focus our attention?

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Do you really think that is sufficient to solve the Federal Reserve, Big Tech, MIC and Jew lobbying problems?

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Sweet. #NAXALT doesn't change the fact that a large majority do not.You realize if we win half of the Dems White vote we steal 20% of their electorate, if we steal 80% of their black vote we don't hit 20% of their electorate.If you want to beat the communists you have to use White identity politics. If is fasteemr and will lead to a more homogeneous society.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior "Dems R the real Racists."I don't give a fuck the reason, I care about the reality. You can debate reason all day, but at the end of the dat 90% of them stand for everything you don't.You will never win with the #DR3 argument and you will never win if you refuse to attack your enemy's demographic.The communists are winning because they realize this and viciously attack Whites with mass immigration, diversity quotas, censorship, and encourage LGBT and fertility lowering activities.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior I don't want to save an insufficient document. I want to make a new one that is less susceptible to subversion.Deconvert? They are multi-generationally dependent peoples. They know nothing else.

@IsaacWestcott @luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior Just going back to requiring all personal degeneracy to be privately funded instead of funded through your taxpayer dollars would be a fight and a half against the current crazed left. We can get started with that and then hash out our disagreements about how far to go later.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior You realize all this shit targets Whites too? And all the negative propaganda associated with it targets Whites, but somehow 80% of ours aren't on government assistance. Somehow their crime rates mirror those of Africa, while ours mirror Europe. Genetics may very well not explain 100%, but it's more than nothing.

@p @yolo @xeno #MURICA

@IsaacWestcott @yolo @xeno Oh, I am too.  But if you're telling me you would lose to some sandwiches, I question your patriotism.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Then why is Africa a shit hole? We have sunk more money into Africa than Europe post 2 world wars, and tbey produce nothing.Even if that's the case, why would you rather fight for blacks than your own people? It doesn't work.How has the Republican pandering to niggers panned out?

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Yes, but under our current system it's never going to happen.Conservatives defend precedents that they despise because of "muh constitution" while the Left circumvents the process to push through their laws.Abortion - will never go away, and now we need it to fix demographicsGovernment Healthcare - will never go away, and now the private sector is so shot it's probably stuckGay Marriage - CONSERVATIVES ACCEPT THEMMinorities who work against voter ID laws - cobservatives put them up for election (look at SC junior senator)Immigration - apparently junior courts can just over rule whole executive actions and departmentsGun Restrictions - you'd be hard pressed to find a cycle in which gun rights have not been infringedIn our system, if the Left wins once on an issue, they win forever. Because this blind constitutionalism and belief that it is possible to limit the system is possible. It is a failed strategy for nearly 100 years. How long will we cling to the hope that the constitution will be resuscitated?

@p @yolo @xeno I'd never finish that plate. I'm a healthy weight you see.

#finishthewallthank you for reading my blog post

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond We're already there. Go post your ideas on immigration on Twitter under your real name and see how long you can stay employed.Free Speech has been outsourced to corporations who don't care. The 1st ammendment protects you from jail, but nothing else in the US.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Reactionary = Neo-Victorian to you? My God you need to stop fixating on the lolis. No sane person wants your anime porn, it's the Left taking your porn so chill the fuck out.Reactionary in this context simply means aiming to reject this increasingly Liberalism in our society and make the purpose of the state to protect rather than control.

@jack @p @yolo @xeno Atzlan, as in the Yucatan?I somehow doubt if they used cartel methods it would benefit us. Look at the number of "refugees" we get from such countries.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond I think we all do, but I don't see that happening without an interim system - which can either work for our purposes or against them.You're not going to polish this turd we have into a golden nugget. It's going to have to be reactionary in nature. The only question is whether we react before or after the communists solidify their power using our current system.

@sjw @yolo @matrix  I rise you even better AI...Source: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/07/new-artificial-intelligence-can-tell-whether-youre-gay-or-straight-from-a-photograph

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond Exactly. How many people are already silenced? That number is only increasing. When the number of people silenced outnumbers those not silenced, which we are moving ever closer towards, remaining faithbin this decaying system will falter.The 2nd ammendment has been infringed again and again, even under Trump. None of the LARPs have done shit - and they have a multi-million lobby group.No political ordee has lasted forever, it's foolish to believe this one will.

this is a DEGNERATE, DARK SKINNED INDIAN NIGGER ,

@rice @sjw @ChristiJunior Nuance is how the right loses. We feel bad and we accept the left's nuance for the sake of the few exceptions.At some point you have to take a hardline or you may as well accept your opponent's narrative. Just because nuance exists, doesn't mean you debate it. You debate the trend and norms.This has been our undoing far too many times over the past centuries, but itvhas only gotten worse recently.

@DetectiveHyde @pea Nice. I see xD

@ChristiJunior @rice @sjw I didn't read beyond the first sentence. I saw unneeded nuance!

@p @moonman BTW, who said anything about fucking them?You don't have to fuck them to be accused of rape.They wait a month then accuse.No evidence necessary.

@sjw @judgedread @p @moonman LoL. Random Decimation.

@sjw @judgedread @p @moonman You're not an SJW. I've seen you virtually rape a girl via text!

@PussySlayer @p Isn't DC judt a slum(70% black) with an upper class enclave?

@DetectiveHyde @pea You do colors? What?

@miya @ArdanianRight @luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond What I said there is something you could actually sell within our current system.I'd preempt to before pregnancy 1 if possible.

@ArdanianRight @luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond Not hard. They are conservatives and as such only good at losing.We only have 2 outs: short term some kind of right-wing military takeover, or long term collapse via socialism.In the latter case it's better to become the commies ourselves and use policies like universal healthcare as a eugenics program.Like it or not solutions aren't coming from the current system. You'll never deport anchor babies, you won't even get illegals.

@luckyp3616 @MKULTRAdiamond Horseshoe theory is fake and gay. There is only fish-hook theory.

@ArdanianRight @luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond We were in the realm of theory.The best you can do now is heavily tax abortions, but wave the tax for HISTORICAL minorities. You can also have doctors recommend abortions and give child scare literature to minorities - there are certain prompts practitioners follow it's a little hard to explain.You could also offer free tube tying to any women on her second abortion and work to eliminate state assistance to single, non-widowed parents to further encourage abortion within those groups.Even limiting immigration is currently outside the realm of "democratic" possibility - so keep that in mind.

@MKULTRAdiamond The White man's pollution will be his savior. Rising sea levels kill shitholers disproportionately, plastics sterilize and they don't have the tech to stimulate them balls, end game of all climate phenomena is increased winters.CHECKMATE BIGOTS!

@MKULTRAdiamond @luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior They've been saying that for years! But seriously microplastics in the water supply are sterilizing the developed world: Europe, NA, East Asia, and Australia. Possibly starting to happen in the ME and LA as well.Sperm counts have been falling ~6% or something per decade. So...that's a thing.Russia is fine somehow, probably has to do with bears and vodka.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond Egalitarianism is a lie. You're not going to find a perfect solution that treats every group equally. We can provide free mandarory abortions and sterilization.Then they can fuck all they want, no problem.Also...implying blacks marryxD

@hyphen @yolo If they want to be accepted not having indecent exposure and public sex in flamboyant parades would be a start.

@hyphen @yolo Muslims throw #fags off rooves.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond I think we could learn something from the 1 child policy.If minorities and immigrants only have 1 child their population theoretically halves every generational group.~50mil blacks - maybe 25mil breeding age. 12.5mil new ones next gen; halve again 6.25mil, each generation a larger and larger portion is non-breeding age.Those groups will age rapidly.We're not getting out of this mess by traditional means and if you want political solutions this is the most peaceful and cost effective.

@yolo @EchoSierraTwo That's some healthy xenophobia.

@IsaacWestcott @EchoSierraTwo just as i fear having a job, i will fear the gay with such a wrath that i will shoot all that come near me "hey check out my new dildo shaped vape i g-" *BANG BANG*25216537_p0.jpg

@yolo @EchoSierraTwo Fair point. But direct that fear into something productive, like disdain. }8D

@EchoSierraTwo @yolo Who's honestly afraid of fags? We're not afraid, we just don't like them.

@yolo 2 retards with one stone. Quite the feat!You just got +1 internet!

@IsaacWestcott I know it's probably a lost cause, but as someone with an IQ of under 70, I don't particularly like when people use the word "retard" as shorthand for "stupid, idiotic person", especially when the "retard" in question is a public figure without a public diagnosis.

@Atrushan そっか。なんでドア？

@PussySlayer @IsaacWestcott @Cyph was about the only thing that was accomplished, on November 9 i sent a message to some jew faggot cuck and rubbed it in his face

@PussySlayer @Cyph I'd have been happy if his first term was primarily firing/downsizing the bureaucracy tbh.That needs to happen before any current or new laws enforced.

@PussySlayer @Cyph I want like him, but I'm consistently disappointed.

LMAObq-5c70a6dd762d5.jpg

@Cyph What a #bigot and a #cuck.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @rasterman @ChristiJunior Mueller is #BigGay.

@luckyp3616 @rasterman @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior So food/restaurant regulations are bad? Like 0 regulation? That's going far.I do believe in laissez faire for small business and heavy regulation on HUGE, near monopolistic businesses (like Google, Lockheed, etc).

@luckyp3616 @rasterman @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Has he really done much on either of these fronts?

@IsaacWestcott @luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Another issue I had as an AnCap. Monopolies, in theory, don't last very long, as new competition should come up and chip away at their control over small parts of the market; but in practise I don't see it. Ever since Rockefeller and Standard Oil, the Osram/Philips cabal of programmed obsolescence (oligopoly) or the Silicon Valley big corporations like Google who is practically THE INTERNET.They buy politicians to make regulations to benefit them. Something's not right with that system.

@luckyp3616 @rasterman @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior He's not a Nazi, he's a Progressive; and one of many.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @rasterman @ChristiJunior What do you mean by this sell off?

@IsaacWestcott @ArdanianRight @rasterman @ChristiJunior Deporting wetbacks and getting that wall up should be #1 priority. We can't fix the damage until we stop further damage from being inflicted.

@luckyp3616 @rasterman @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Trust bust. Monopolies are not free market.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @rasterman Look at illegals per country + Dem vote map.It's nearly perfect overlap. Same for crime, diversity index, and corruption xD

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @IsaacWestcott True; but again: it's proving to be effectively impossible to deport the illegals. Every day that passes, the wall gets 10 feet shorter.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond I'm going to probe a bit.What do you think about child limits to immigrants and "minorities?"Say 1 child per to help reverse trends? Maybe provide assistance/incentive for our own short term to speed it up?

@luckyp3616 @rasterman @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Well the trends need to be reversed, and the invaders/harbingers of communism deported.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond Let's be honest, niggers are worse. Jews both their handlers.

@rasterman @luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior If we move culture away from egalitarianism, multiculturalism, and other such enlightenment ideals discussion of such ideas will become obsoleted.

@IsaacWestcott @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond Exactly. Honestly, though, I think they would lose if we were in a bubble and no further immigration was possible. I think their plan right now is to weaponize immigration. Shutting of that should be our priority.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond Well we lose via internal demographics currently, even if 0 immigration.We need to do some deports and other tricky things. Hence, why I see total war against rebellious South Western states as a shortcut.

@luckyp3616 @rasterman @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Working to maintain 95%+ White demographics would help with that.We definitely need to attack and not degend. Now you're sounding #strongk.

@rasterman @ArdanianRight @IsaacWestcott @ChristiJunior I also think we need to limit things like social security and stuff to citizens only while it is still here. If we are going to have it, we can't be giving our money to wetbacks.People who are disabled have to be helped, but anyone who isn't disabled and is able to work, should work. We should not give out free shit to people who are able to work, but don't.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @MKULTRAdiamond @ChristiJunior This is very closely aligned to my own view.100% Endorsement. Prove you the strongest!

@ArdanianRight @MKULTRAdiamond @IsaacWestcott @ChristiJunior The first thing that needs to be done is cut off the immigration spigot. I think having a policy of 95% natural born where only 5% of the population can be immigrants is a must. We would have to have many years of zero new immigrants, but so be it.

@IsaacWestcott @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond The issue is that we need to start fighting back against these socialists. First thing we need to do is cut off the Immigration spigot.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond Definitely a step in the right direction, but it barely scratches the surface.

@IsaacWestcott @luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior If only the constitution said something about blood & soil being important.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @MKULTRAdiamond @ChristiJunior The Constitution is already dead. It's been deas. Do you honestly think this system is anything close to what the founders wanted?It was insufficient to sustain the society it was envisioned to protect. We need to learn from it and make something better, but that's not going to happen if people like you keep defending our mutual enemies with its corpse.

@luckyp3616 @MKULTRAdiamond @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior You're an idiot. I'm not defending against your lies.Keep fighting the last war and being autistically fixated with masterbation.

@luckyp3616 @MKULTRAdiamond @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior I never said that. You're literally making shit up.

@luckyp3616 @MKULTRAdiamond @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior I never made an argument against fapping you massive #cuck.Jerk off to your heart's content.

@ArdanianRight @MKULTRAdiamond @ChristiJunior @IsaacWestcott We can't be criminalizing things just because society says so. There should be a real reason behind a law, not just "oh that offends me!"

@luckyp3616 @MKULTRAdiamond @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Sweet. Keep fighting the last war. It's been failing for decades, but certainly it can't fail forever - especially with the Left rapidly radicalizing and mobilizing.

@IsaacWestcott @luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond A piece of paper doesn't do shit if it's not reinforced by strong societal norms. The population's accepted total NSA surveillance while the 4th Amendment did jack shit, and the 1st and 2nd Amendments will follow likewise once demographic change does its thing.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond I'm not a bible thumper you idiot.If you are more concerned with the freedom of your enemies than stopping them then they will take your freedom.It's happening, RIGHT NOW.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @MKULTRAdiamond Ever heard of the Civil War? I seem to recall total war being waged on rebelling states.If you are this much of a slave to a document that has failed to preserve your ideals and continually degrades them you will keep losing.There are things to praise and preserve, but if you think the US government is eternal you're a fucking idiot.

@luckyp3616 @MKULTRAdiamond @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior I'm not stating my POV, you #fag. I'm stating a line of argument that WILL BE MADE, you #fuckWit.1st Amendment? How's that working now exactly? Laws are what you make them. Pornography used to not be protected by it. If you keep autistically defending positions for you're opponent you will keep losing.Stick with this line of argument if you want gays, miscegenation, trannies, furries, pedos, and God knows what else to continue to become normalized and celebrated.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @neptuna @comfy Just play Marth.

@luckyp3616 @ArdanianRight @MKULTRAdiamond @ChristiJunior If they try mix martial law/total war. Just letting it happen sets a bad precedent.However, we should encourage it. :1011: :bestcountry:

@luckyp3616 @MKULTRAdiamond @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Ok, but the users aren't abusing them. You need objective standards, not subjective.Depending on your argument a user of child porn is either victimizing by creating demand, or not because they are not touching anyone.By that same logic a drug user could be victimizing abused drug mules, because they are creating a demand which sustains these business practices.You need norms and laws. You need to enforce them in regards to what is best to society, not some niche outlier need or arbitrary judgement that crime A is not as bad as crime B; and thus less important to enforce. That's how you get societal breakdown.

@luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior How is that related to academia? And do you really think limited government is going to fix our demographic/commie issue?How successful has the right been at limiting government? Maybe we need to reformulate our strategy and use it to crush our enemies, then worry about limiting it.

@luckyp3616 @MKULTRAdiamond @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Depends. Would you let a drug smuggler go? Is that victimless?What about child pornography USERS? Would that be victimless?They LGBT6milX needs to stop. I doubt you're going to accompish that with support from many in that community.That community is effectively a political enemy. So don't hold back on their behalf.

@luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior How do you mean? What would you propose?

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @luckyp3616 Hard deports too.

@MKULTRAdiamond @DomAfonsoHenriques @ChristiJunior If your enemies want to kill you, you just might have to destroy them. Amirite?

@luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @MKULTRAdiamond Live and let live does not work within the same polity - at least in the sense that I believe you to mean. It can work internationally (ie separate systems), but what you're seeing now is a break down.We either forego our tolerance and fight for ourselves, or we lose. It's that simple.Your endless nuance and exceptions leave room for debate.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @luckyp3616 I'll 1 up you, Muslim ban period.

@luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior Is this an argument for or against the Civil Rights Act?Because it was a mistake.

@luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior Why am I @ with this?

@luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior Trans panic? If you think gay marriage is good for a healthy society you're impotent to stop the leftist agenda regarding trannies; as you will be for every other hot topic social issue to come.

@luckyp3616 @ChristiJunior It's a mental disorder. Treat it as such.

@ChristiJunior @luckyp3616 I'm also going to "white knight" a bit here. Western women aren't any worse than other women. The problem is the media and legal system encourages them to act poorly. But stats show happily married women - that's something that takes 2 - tend to chill and vote with their men. Many aspects of college life turn women into sluts, but they also turn our men into soy creatures. No woman wants an effeminate loser, so the incentive to mature into a respectable woman doesn't present itself.

@ChristiJunior @luckyp3616 It's always going to cross the line when an exception is made.Enjoy failing to prevent pedophile "rights" in 8 years after trans-sexuals are completely normalised and teaching your kids how to buy hormones on your tax dollar.You can't stop (((progress))) if you agree with its core principles.

@PussySlayer @jack @rasterman @p You're leaving out a key aspect. The bans for violating TOS are applied selectively, the same way laws are enforced selectively. The left acts as a lawless vigilante terror force aided by the mods and reports the right for being rude.

I was recently talking to my dad about the whole privacy vs "I have nothing to hide," discussion going on recently and he gave me an interesting insight. Forty years ago the idea that your government would open and read every item of post that was delivered regardless of delivery company would have been preposterous and a breach of privacy that media and citizen would condemn in unison as dangerous government overreach.And yet here we are today with essentially the same thing happening in the digital sense and the general public seem ambivalent at best and complacent at worst.

@weeb Twitter is a fluoridated pile of corporate shit. A disgusting cesspool. If Pleroma® represents the Free Market Of Ideas™ (a term witches.live types use ironically but that actually represents something awesome) then Twitter is the "one race, the human race" fluoride infested "melting pot" of ideas.Whereas the fediverse keeps ideas vibrant and distinct and lets them fight, change, shift, dodge, weave, win and lose, Twitter mixes all the ideas together into a brown melting pot of pure shit. The sheer volume of absolutely TRASH ideas on Twitter and the sheer number of dumb assholes who believe them means that any good idea is just completely drowned out by a cacophony of HORSE SHIT.This is what happens on sites like le reddit that have le upvotes too. Its LITERALLY the Tyranny of the Majority.

I'm making less than 1/3 what I did and missed out on countless promotions, but it was worth it. Life is more than money or advancement, it's about experiences.Enjoy it while you can!

I'm going to miss these old books. I already long for them them. There is nothing like a hard cover book.

@judgedread @sarchasm I don't disagree, but getting the right guy will be hard.Like you say, Trump is unlikely to do what is necessary to become God-Emperor. He'd have to do what Boloroso did RIGHT WHEN HE GOT INTO OFFICE, as well as: bust the techopolies, Academia (which Miller seems to be eyeing), and MSM.He is definitely putting those ideas out in the open, but if he doesn't do so, what's to say come 2024 the, likely, Democrat POTUS will not fortify these aforementioned sources of power?

@sarchasm @judgedread I think he's alluding to potential collapse.

Never fight the enemy if you don't have to.  Instead, destroy, deplete, or turn what makes that enemy powerful.  Whether ideologies, resources, or followings.

@judgedread Once some leaders will balls step up. Willingness at the top is lacking.The common man is ready for the bull shit to end. Visit any blue collar community and sure they know to recite all the right sound-bites, but beyond that they're pretty honest, and it doesn't align with the Progressives.

@ArdanianRight @Oblivia The thing about alt-tech is that the basic technoligies that govern the internet are still largely sound. For example if I wanted to set up a secure Irc-chat system for everyone, that could be easily done. Hell, it could be done as a hidden Tor site. Same with XMPP-chat. These morons that keep saying "Well you try building a platform"....A platform is not really needed.

@matrix @sjw I'm pretty sure this is "The Whitest Kids You Know"

@ArdanianRight That's giving the trannies way too much credit - they want to look and act like hideous freaks in public and not only be tolerated, but actively celebrated for it.Also, "cis" in this context is a retarded term that should never be used non-ironically. Trannies are an insignificant minority of dysfunctional freaks, normal people don't need a special term to signify that we're not trannies, just like normal-sized people don't need a special term to signify that they're not midgets. Calling oneself "cis" is just a way to normalize trannies and the SJW gender ideology. Normal is a better, more accurate and more honest term for the same thing.

@ArdanianRight @judgedread @sarchasm @11112011 You shouldn't discount that he may just lack talent. Most people aren't cut out for entrepreneurship.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Tolerance will lead to acceptance. I refer you to every Progressive issue in the 20th century, and the firsr of the 21st - "Gay Rights."

@ChristiJunior Progressives are the Conservatives of tomorrow. You're seeing it happen real time.Conservatives act as a funnel to Progressivism, they let the ideas seep into the mainstream, they just slow it down so the masses are forced to accept 1 issue at a time.Look at Ben Shapiro on transexuals 5 years ago and look at how he NOW parades around Blaire White as part of his "Conservative" faction.

This is amazing. Snopes fact checked Babylon Bee.

@yolo @dead If we close the borders I support bombing as many brown people as you want.

@yolo @dead My God! It's happened, you've gone full #Zio. We're going to have to put you to pasture in Oklahoma.

@yolo @dead I never thought that you off all people swallowed the #neoconPill. Did Bolton do this to you? Have you started loving Jews spontaneously and for no reason?

@Revenant410 @orangesec_0 When blacks stop commiting 10x the amount of violent crime against Whites in GROSS NUMBER, I'll look to that as a possibility.Until then a nigger is a nigger is a nigger.

@yolo I don't see how the rain forest preps for winter warfare. This must be Texas meta logic beyond my comprehension.It's probably got something to do with too many mexicants.

@yolo That'd be the plan. If we close them borders I'm all about being a pirate state. May as well use this bloated military budget for our benefit amir?Can we toss our Mexicants there 2?

@yolo I wish. What'll end up happening is half their commies flee the country and flood Texas. Then of course we'll feel so bad for them that we'll give them magical papers and call them American.

@yolo ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!

@judgedread @Oblivia @PussySlayer @comfy @ArdanianRight Richard has shilled for Zionism on multiple occasions and makes a point to compare us to them. Regardless the intelligence behind it I don't think it coincidental.

@judgedread @Oblivia @PussySlayer @IsaacWestcott @comfy Better to have no analytics at all and just produce your content than use anything from Google.

@judgedread @Oblivia @PussySlayer @comfy @ArdanianRight I honestly think a good number on the 'Alt-Right' as it were are hoping to be co-opted by the rich Jews they mock.They'd be happy in a ZOG state. So long as the West is White they'll fight for Greater Israel. Richard has basically said so himself.

@meowski @p @MKULTRAdiamond @rin @Oblivia No can do. I'm on the Keto. I do toss some cheese in there too, if that helps.

@meowski @p @MKULTRAdiamond @rin @Oblivia I've been on the Steak and Egg diet. 1lb of steak and 4 eggs a day.

If I ever move to a foreign country, the first thing I'm doing is converting to the majority religion. The second thing I'm doing is creating a paper trail of how much I love the country, the locals, the general system of government without any partisan bias.The last thing I'm doing is telling the majority that they have no right to consider themselves unique, that they're the worst people in the country, and that I am necessary for their survival.Be a BASED™ and redpilled foreigner. Not a fucking cringe and blupilled retard who gets expelled in ten years.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @djsumdog @PussySlayer We can only hope. #SoCal needs to just become the dumping ground for all the trash.Those bottom 8-10 counties should be filled with all the section 8 housing that exists elsewhere in the US. Provide for them the conditions to which their people are accustomed.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @djsumdog @PussySlayer Perhaps, but never rely soley on your opponent's stupidity. That is the road towards becoming a contemporary Republican. :0350:

@meowski @MKULTRAdiamond @rin @Oblivia I meant that cholesterol being a horrific poison was a psyop, but "psyop" in the "I'm beginning to think nutritionists do not know what they are doing" sense rather than the literal sense.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @djsumdog @PussySlayer Yes. But those were niggers. Their lack of intelligence seems to make them immune to the poisons of Liberalism, thus they can do that.Whites on the other hand view outsiders as equals worthy of respect. Many are so atomized that they think their neighborhoods can be on fire, but if their house remains untouched it'll be OK.It'll take an economic collapse, which since every field of import is jammed with diversity hires shouldn't take long.

@p @sadcatstarry @hyphen THAT'S THE SHIT THAT'S TURNING THE FROGS GAY!

@BugmanExtraordinaire @djsumdog @PussySlayer In my experience Hindus tend to not get that it is a privilege to be here. Clearly the English spoiled them.

@meowski @p @MKULTRAdiamond @rin @Oblivia Eggs make this very confusing. High protein, higher cholesterol.

@djsumdog @BugmanExtraordinaire @PussySlayer A passport doesn't make you American, or German, or Indian, or Japanese. It makes you a citizen, but outside the Western world this concept hardly exists on a non-ethnic basis. Hence, why we are being flooded unlike everywhere else.Companies wanted cheaper labor and leftists wanted more votes, that's why you're here. We didn't need more engineers there are more than enough real Americans with that education forced into factory jobs, because Diversity demands it and unlike imported labor the degrees here cost money, so they need paychecks. What we need is a system where we aren't expected to cater to every, single group interest other than our own.

@djsumdog If I moed to India, spent my whole life there, and even had kids there, do you know the one word me and my kids would NEVER be called? Indian.

@igeljaeger @ChristiJunior @orekix Don't presume to @ me with that after being rude!

@IsaacWestcott @igeljaeger @orekix "Racism" as a concept has since it became mainstream just been a weapon wielded against White people. The anti-White double standards are a feature, not a bug.Do you not want your (White) countries flooded by millions of 3rd worlders every year? Racist!Do you oppose laws that discriminate against White people for the benefit for nonwhites? Racist!Do you want to have an open, honest and fact-based discussion about Crime and Race? Racist!Do you oppose the criminalization of "hate speech"? Racist!Do you dislike the idea of mass immigration and anti-White propaganda turning White people into a despised, disenfranchised minority in their own countries? Racist!

@vix @orekix @igeljaeger 56% of violent crimes are commited by 13% of the population.

@igeljaeger @orekix That's about as much nuance anyone understands, and is thus all that is necessary.

@orekix @igeljaeger Good luck spreading a nuanced message en mass.A vast majority of people don't understand nuance.

@orekix @igeljaeger You're still anti-Jew. Don't act all high and mighty.

@igeljaeger @Rude @orekix You can't live off the grid, as cringe as it sounds, it's true.

@igeljaeger @orekix Well I got out. But 30% of Americans now go to college. A great number have obviously bought into the narrative.

@igeljaeger @Rude @orekix Sweet. You live in a sociey, a larger culture. And that society currently is working counter to individual freedoms and values.

@igeljaeger @orekix In the US racism against Whites is impossible. Just denying "white privilege" as a relevant issue nearly got me expelled.

@orekix @igeljaeger That's not what university teaches. They are in bed with the state.

@igeljaeger @Rude @orekix Those are our core issues. You think all men are equal? You think our cultures aren't so focused on not offending people and leaving no one behind that literal nanny states have formed?Germanybis a prime example. It self-flogs constantly, lets anyone in who cries oppression, and supports the life style of the lowest dredges of society.

@igeljaeger @orekix They are radicalized. I went back for grad school recently...the amount of violent rhetoric towards Whites is insane.

@igeljaeger @orekix @Rude Bro, political shit aside, you really owe it to yourself to go and experience TES properly as a series. The writing is the most high quality shit ever. Once you have a bit of lore under your belt and can properly UNDERSTAND the events of Skyrim it's fucking BANANAS.To just quickly explain the jew joke:Mer = antinature, want to destroy the Towers that hold up the physical world so that we can all go back to Anu (stasis)Men = nature, want to keep the Towers in place and keep living on Tamriel, which as Mundus, is ultimately Padomay (dynamism)A sub-race of Mer is the AltmerA religious sect of the Altmer is the ThalmorThe Thalmor are the ones who have "realised" the thing abut destroying Mundus/Nirn/Tamriel and returning us to static antinature. It's the raison d'etre for their entire race, but most don't care about religion or supremacy and are just living their lives. The Thalmor are the enemy.Hence the Jew analogy, lol. Most are just unfortunate religious people. A handful run the world and hate us all and hate the world we live in. Shame.(It should also be noted that the Dunmer are Mer, but they create exceptional people like Vivec who realise the problem with the whole "return to Anu" thing and lead their people to a different destiny. I like this detail a lot. for about the last 9000 years of TES canon, it's just the Dunmer (and... the beast races I think?) alone on the fucking moon trying to create a more Padomaic world, and rebelling against their Anuic destiny.)

@igeljaeger @orekix @Rude It's a combination. Western Culture has become too inclusive and nannish. It operates on the assumption that all men are equal and the same.Certainly Jews are exploiting this system and by extension us, but at this point even if the Jew (tumor) is removed the underlying cause (cancer/liberalism) remains. It would not be possible if we (Whites) as a people didn't expect/demand government pander to everyone's needs at the expense of our freedom.

@orekix @Dayglochainsaw Unfortunately. Weak leaders lead to subpar solutions.

I take away two things from this:a) equating the Left with entropy is both funny and oddly accurate; andb) my keyboard looks less unholy now. Works the same.Just in case: https://youtu.be/p6LUjUbikkk

@judgedread @ArdanianRight So you deem organizational infrastructure priority. What exactly does that entail?

@judgedread @ArdanianRight That's true. My concern is the employment side. You can't just have a check from your work sent to your PO BOX. They use systems like Paycor that connect your employment to a bank. It's systems like these that we definitely need some people focusing on. Even forming our own credit unions and Paycor like services would be a boon. It'd be a lot easier to engage the wider populace with such systems.

@1w4kvra @IsaacWestcott Ancient democracy where the qualified voted and the unlearned didn't was the ideal big scale government system. But muh universal suffrage and people are born equal shit

@nerthos @1w4kvra Basically, Enlightenment ideas.

@orekix @IsaacWestcott Monarchies aren't necessarily more authoritarian than any other type of government. The absolute king over serfs meme was very limited in implementation. Most monarchies had bills of rights and proper legislation, and the population could actively push for changes, as much as now at least.Some monarchies like the Swedish one had representatives of each social/economic class to take decisions along the king.As Isaac said, the only difference with democracy is that they legitimize the abuse of authority by saying "the people voted us here, thus this is the will of the people" and they have a nice excuse to put down any attempt at wrestling back control.In most pre-industrial monarchies, except for the demand to contribute men to your lord's army in times of conflict, people had arguably more freedom than now. And since military power was in the hands of local bannermen and not the king directly, regions had a direct say on what gets done as otherwise the king could quickly find himself outmatched in a revolt. Now regions and states have no armies of their own to pressure the central government.There are a lot of quality of life improvements in modernity when compared to antiquity, but freedom isn't one of them.

@1w4kvra Restricting voting within a universal suffrage system via traditional legal means is neigh impossible.

@WIR @orangesec_0 ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!

@orekix Our governments serve us no more than theirs. In fact, we're told our only purpose is to be a cog in the economy and as such we need open borders, diversity initiatives, and any number of progressive bull shit. Disagree? Well you're a Nazi and you can no longer be employed or have any livelihood. We are expected to treat outsiders who shit on our way of life, despise the very freedoms our nations were founded upon, and hand more and more power to these very authorities as our own - or else.Our elite are using immigration to push more and more totalitarian laws, ultimately what good are we to them if we want freedoms? They use hate speech laws to curtail and limit dialogue, and that just feeds everything else.We face different challenges than those countries you imply, but outside our increasingly narrow creature comforts are we better off? In a generation or 2 of this BS and the only difference between us and these states you imply is social trust will be completely shot as well thanks to the vibrant diversity being foisted upon us.

@orangesec_0 You're really passionate about stuffing.

@orangesec_0 Let's say all the Jew billionares are White. It still doesn't mean the average White is objectively better off. If anything the lack of barriers "minorities" are made to face mixed with the increasingly lax standards means the opposite is true.

@orangesec_0 Insulting your culinary choices is what it took?

@undeadmockingbird I wish people kept the source on these article clips. It's like they enjoy making it difficult.

#MockingbirdFortunesmedia.jpg

@orekix That's not been proven. The fact remains never before has governmental power been so vast and so centralized as it has under liberal democracy.Democracy gives people the illusion that it's OK, because they can vote. So they hand more and more to the government.

@orekix I'm not convinced that's true. I don't vthink we're objectively more free than we were during monarchies.Governments are far stronger now than they've ever been and they just keep growing in power. Since the bureaucracy is so complex we don't even know who controls what and I doubt our "leaders" do either.Instead of being ruled by individuals we are ruled by faceless ideas.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight That's not really Alt-Finance, that's a work around within the current system.While it may be adequate for now you're basically agreeing that we are limited to the scraps of modern finance.This is also no way to fund and build up a true Alt-Tech platform(s). Sure we can get by on open source and crowd-funding for now, but this method is not sufficient long term.

@ChristiJunior @dielan You should see East Asian censorship.

Close borders.Incentivize people with middle class incomes to have more kids.IN THAT ORDER.

@ArdanianRight @judgedread Gavin acts as if we didn't live under a Left dominated culture, his mistake is thinking he can be anything other than completely professional on the Right without being written off as either a hillbilly or Nazi goon.

@1w4kvra You can't vote your way out of universal suffrage.

@tuxcrafting A little negative. We could be communist, but we've yet to stoop that low. :0000:

@IsaacWestcott @ArdanianRight If immigration is limited that's a massive victory. In fact it's all that's needed for the right to begin retaking the nation.If the US becomes an unsafe space for enemy cultures to colonize they will self deport in vast numbers.

@tuxcrafting Unfettered capitalism occurs within liberal democracies. You'd not see the same dynamic in a Monarchy or dictatorship and neither would be able to hide behind the pretext if "free markets" in order to accomplish what corporations are under Democracy.

@tuxcrafting We live under a system where censorship and punishment for wrongthink has been outsourced to private multinationals which our governments conveniently refuse to break up and which grow stronger by the day.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight There would be nothing to gain from blocking Carlson. Tucker is mainstream enough, his message may differ a bit from the narrative, but he'll never challenge immigration on a racial level, he'll never speak against gay marriage, and I doubt you'll see him question transsexuals when they become normalized. They don't have to defund the entire Right if the mainstream Right accepts their worldview within a decade or so, they just need to silence those who would alter the trajectory of the Right towards intolerance for the new norms.We're not going to challenge this system by working within it, just as you won't discuss facts from UCR data to back your claims on Twitter without getting banned for "hate speech." Alt-Tech requires Alt-Finance in order to be sustainable, else we are limited to open source frameworks.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight What?

Tip of the Day:Democracy is #BigGay

@igeljaegerI've just embraced the label. Not wanting to import unlimited brown people makes you a Nazi - so fuck it.You live in a country where 13% of your population commits 56% of violent crimes and tell me you want more of those people.@cereal @fred @ilovecomputers

@cereal @igeljaeger @fred @ilovecomputers I refer to my earlier statement: #DemocracySucks

@igeljaeger @fred @ilovecomputers @cereal You're a Euro - all your parties are socialist by default.

@cereal @igeljaeger @fred @ilovecomputers That's some mean black pill. I don't know from my perspective you Euros got it easy. You can actually get a party formed and fix this shit. Your demographics aren't the sewage shitshow of the US or Canada.

@cereal @igeljaeger @fred @ilovecomputers Need to get over the stigma and vote for your local Nazis.

@igeljaeger @fred @ilovecomputers #DemocracySucks

@igeljaeger @fred @ilovecomputers How is Germany going anyway? I've heard you're starting to deport the roaches? How off is that?

@judgedread @ArdanianRight I dont believe that the tech is ultimately as dangerous as the banks.As we've seen someone as dumb as Torba can start a #SocMed site. Had he been slightly competent it may have even done half as well as Twitter.The last stage of attack would be via payment processors and banks. They stay out if able, but they can already deny service for divergence from orthodoxy. How long until just supporting or allowing dissident people on your platform can lead to financial cock blocking?

@judgedread @neptuna @ArdanianRight Currently open source is our best bet. In our current environment I'm not certain that it's feasible to create our own infrastructure. All levels from funding to hosting are against us.If we want our own infrastructure we may have to go #YellowVest and try to form our own bank. However, I'm not confident that would end too well.

Enemy is that which cannot be negotiated with, only defeated.There are conflicts of interest that can only be resolved by one side ceasing to exist.

@judgedread @neptuna @ArdanianRight There is no doubt in my mind they will keep winning unless the Right is able to radically shift.Just because the ascent of the Left may come to a premature close due to demographic transformation of their own design doesn't mean we aren't going to keep losing up until that point. It's a matter of how much ground we can hold when it all comes crashing down.

@judgedread @neptuna @ArdanianRight It's still hard to believe they are dumb enough to sabatogue themselves, but they continually do so.However, I'm not so certain that means they'll lose in the end. Surely the Right thought similarily of the Left back before the Senate system was changed, black suffrage, women's suffrage, civil rights, social security, Roe v Wade, gay rights, yet here we are today.You'd never find someone on the Right contest any of these - precedents and all that. Once transexuals are normalized you'll see the same thing.We mock these people, but fact of the matter is no matter how scared they may be, they are winning.

@PussySlayerResearch you say...anything of interest?

@xeno @igeljaeger XENOS

@yolo @igeljaeger @levi @xeno @orekix Bountiful!

@yolo @xeno @igeljaeger Serms far-fetched. Unless it was a Westboro girl.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight It's exactly because of that incident that I think they'd want to play it safe and not attempt to crucify another figure on the right.Doubling down is about the dumbest thing they can do. Time is on their side if they wait. The only thing making Right wingers look beyond Cuckservatism Inc. is their over zealousnesd.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight Well this I don't know about.

@ArdanianRight @judgedread @PussySlayer I've only ever kissed his ass, he looked dumb in his reply, but it was still boot licking.If you all think of good questions I still have enough rapport with him.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight For what would he go to prison? I get that many want to lynch Bowers and kill Gab, but wouldn't going after Torba be dumb?It looks over zealous, it angers MANY #MAGApedes, adds to the growing distrust of institutions, and could energize some of the more retarded factions on the Right.

@judgedread @ArdanianRight Really dumb reasoning. You're probably right, but that's still REALLY DUMB!

@judgedread Whose quote is that?

@chara That's pretty funny.

@ArdanianRight The issue is that Conservatism agrees with the basic premises of the Left: Universalism and Egalitarianism. It's vision is merely stability, status quo, profit, and progress (I'm using this in the technological/economic sense). This is quite similar to classical liberalism.I'm not even certain the left wants what you desire or even knows what it desires - some actors certainly, but not the vast majority. Say the Left achieves this society, it will not last. They will want more, more change, more progress, more profit, and most importantly MORE. Liberalism is idealizes a process, the change, the victims, and evolution of social norms. Everything else is just in the way.The reactionary vision needs to be rooted in people, not ideas. Leadership and decisions need be made on what us best for our people, not abstractions like progress, freedom, profit, etc. These are all a means, not an end. That's why under our current system more is never enough. The goal is not tangible nor is it attainable. The goal is rooted in ideas that stress the need for continual change, continual progress, and infinite growth.Our vision must be for a people and the maintainence of a society in which the people come first. In order to bring this about we need our people to care for their own more than others, their people more than profit, and society more than their bank account.I fully expect kick back here, it will be easier to illustrate via a challenge anyway.

@WIR @chara I'd like to install a HAM. I suck at them bc my job worked me like a horse and I had to quit going to the local HAM meet ups. :0100:

@ArdanianRight Remember under Liberalism 99 victories for Conservatives and 1 victory for Progressives is a victory for the Left. Because that change becomes mainstream, it thus pushes all discourse to the Left. Many Republicans accept gays now - 10 years ago they wouldn't. Miscegenation is not just seen as normal, but good - just 50 years ago it would have been an abomination.Liberalism compounds upon itself and every win adds to the avalanche. It is not enough to merely delay the progressive agenda, we need to burn down the Cathedral of the Medici and build a new Temple on its ashes.

@ArdanianRight The main issue being that Enlightenment ideas are inherently Universalist and Egalitarian. I don't see anyway to separate components from their core at pace fast enough to combat the replacement migration.>kick everyone out who does not abide by these ideals<This statement itself is counter to Enlightenment ideas. Presuming you somehow justify it, by and large it would need be racial in nature as applying #NAXALT across entire populations becomes unwieldy fast.We have precious little time to influence populists and hard-line right wingers towards a reactionary sentiment. It's not enough to pause here, much has to be undone, and a new course counter to Liberalism set in motion - or we lose this momentum. That is the end for the colonies, Europe may yet have a fighting chance in the future, but losing a continent is quite a blow.

@chara I've always hated cars with modern systems. I'd like to find an old retro volvo and fix that up.Big. Reliable. No Hackable Tech.



@chris @ChristiJunior You're at least half right in my view. There is a lot to be done to fix this country and the West at large. Some important first steps are breaking up the media monopolies and closing our borders to those outside this sphere.

@chris @ChristiJunior Fair point. However, if the societies that they created were so great they wouldn't be fleeing to ours at such a rapid rate.There is no reason we should be expected to sustain and nurture these people, and grant them the same political and economic rights as our own within our own nations.

@yolo You're a he? What else have you been hiding from me?Keep this up and no supper tonight!

@IsaacWestcott @PussySlayer @Oblivia any woman who wants you to sign a legal marriage contract with the government is a huge red flag. Marriage is in the eyes of God, why would anyone want to involve the government, a third party?

@PussySlayer @MKULTRAdiamond @Oblivia I didn't eat fast food until I was ~16. My family is super opposed to the fast food industry.

@MKULTRAdiamond @PussySlayer @Oblivia Great reason to have kids with a GF and not a wife. She just has to work part time, make 1200/mo - and you can focus career. You save on childcare by having her stay at home too.Game the system, let your taxes pay for your kids instead of others. Fuck the kikes!

@chris Yeh...war in Venezuela so smart. We already have shit demographics compared to Europe. I'm fully expecting a swarm in the next couple decades.

@shanehawkk I guess tribes should get female circumcision redefined as protected trans surgery then. It'll immediately go from being an abomination to being a human right.

@PussySlayer @MKULTRAdiamond @Oblivia I've never had Long John Silvers.

@matrix@gameliberty.club

@karen Tbf, that statement deserves some bullying.

Making a Twitter - because I have to use it to get info feeds - and White nationalism is a selectable interest.The spergs must have worn them down.

@MKULTRAdiamond @yolo @ThatWallflower I choose for them all to die.

@PussySlayer I'm going to fuck with tweepy now. My march towards 日本の勝利 is nearly complete!

@yolo @ThatWallflower Trannies who remain interested in the biological opposite sex are among the worst predators. Surpassed only by pedos and possibly animal rapists.

@PussySlayer subl is a pretty cool function. I see why you recommend Sublime now.

@IsaacWestcott @philip Google execs should be slowly dipped into hot lava.

@ArdanianRight That exception is rooted in the MQ way of thought.Unless Europeans and their disapora become ethnocentric again we lose. There is no alternate path. If it is achieved it will be quite easy to turn this shit around.We're not going to infect the rest of the world with Liberalism and Enlightenment ideas before our extinction and come out on top, or even alive, in a multiculti paradise.

Conspiracy theories are so boring.People with a shitload of money and power want more.That's globalism.How to stop them?Take all their money away.

@PussySlayer @philip I'd choose Sergey Brin, but Tim Cook is understandable.

@tinker The solution is clear: we must make computers worse.

Eggs are the most versatile food.#ChangeMyMind

@yolo @rin "Wolfgirl" getting a headstart on my meta plan I see.

@chara @Oblivia I hate whiggers and cucks, but other than that White men are no different than White women in our current (((culture))).

@ArdanianRight That still doesn't explain their disproportionate representation in *certain* institutions - sheer numbers would not make their amount of overrepresentation possible to such an extent without *something* else (ethnocentrism).

@yolo @rin Indeed. That's the linguistic prowess which we seek!

@ArdanianRight That high Jew IQ is fairly questionable. Jews are ~80% of Israel and average IQ is 98. Sure they have 20% arab, but that's no excuse. We're 13% Nigger and 20% Hispanic (close to Arab IQ) and our National average is 102. I doubt Americans (real Americans) are that much more intelligent than Europeans.Not to mention even assuming their "high IQ" is accurate there would still be more 115+ IQ Whites than total Jews. Ethnocentrism is the key to their success. They will always choose another Jew, if we apply that attitude amongst our circles we can win easily.

@yolo This is an understandable problem. The linguistic switch can be onerous.I don't quite understand why you're speaking with a bunch of "it people" rather than throwing them in ovens, but I'll trust your judgement.

@yolo I thought we were on #KAFE #4EVER since that rune speaking kike revealed himself.

@ArdanianRight These are all symptoms, not causes.

@ZettaiRyouiki Simple answer: We should not try to be "allies". Any Straight White Male who today supports the Left or "social justice" is a fucking idiot. The Left's agenda isn't "equality", it's reducing White Men to Nigger Status, taking away our rights, throwing due process out of the window when it comes to us (look at the Kavanaugh debacle, look at the social media lynching of the Covington kids) and stealing the fruits of our labor.The RATIONAL position for a Straight White Man today is to be a White Nationalist of some sort and unapologetically Pro-Male/Masculinity. I for one won't spend a second more of my life fighting for the rights of nonwhites, sexual minorities or women.

@DetectiveHyde @ihavebigtits @sim My point was not the plant, it was that the right allows thought to become normalized and weakly opposes it with some technicality. Thus it loses the debate and it begins to lose the next battle.

@chara @cy The only correct percent in that situation is 0%.Any greater a perversion.

@chara @cy Well some of the white leftists view forcing women into tbe workforce as accomplishing that very goal.They view making women economic units like men as some form of progress.

@DetectiveHyde @ihavebigtits @sim It's better to use contemporary examples to illustrate, you want me to go search for some obscure debate over miscegenation? Maybe I could dig up some arguments over the Magna Carta?

@chara @cy He said he enjoys the lack of competition posed by fags.He's probably just a nihilistic soyboy who has read too much buzzfeed.

@cy @chara That makes 0 sense. I'm glad you're done because that was a dumb and nonsensical as your last statement. Probably because it was the same exact drivel, but with less words.What you call patriarchy is actually men and women living complimentary lives where they can work together to provide for and nuture the next generation. Instead, we are forcing women to compete with men for resources and pursue a hollow lifestyle leaving them unfulfilled and alone.

@tuxcrafting @yolo Yolo you were right. Now these commie kikes are coming in with their fucking demonic desert runes.#KAFE #4EVER

@yolo @rin Where do you find these super specific photos? That's some net skill.

@yolo You spell #coffee differently and incorrectly everytime.Did the Jews do this to you?

@cy @IsaacWestcott 3b3. modern women are LOST. they are HELPLESS, AFRAID, and ALONE. and jew world order aims to keep it that way FOREVER. modern women have been separated from their family separated from their community, separated from their nation, separated from their race, separated from their religion, separated from everything that would give them structure and purpose in life. jew world order has sentenced women to drift through a meaningless void of drugs, money, and nigger sex

@matrix Of things xDWell whatever the reason I support the action!

@cy @chara Literally nothing you said made any sense. You made a bunch of baseless assertions.I'm much more merciful than chara, I don't think they should be executed, I'd rather have them lead cultural exchange programs in countries that we dislike, ideally involving as many children as possible.They'll either degrade their society so it's weak enough to be exploited - much like ours is now - or be killed by the native populace. Either way it's a win-win, but at least they have a chance to be useful.

@cy @IsaacWestcott 1. nobody wants to kill straight people "for being bad for society", because straight people literally aren't bad for society, and everyone knows it.2. you're not straight.3. traditional gender roles worked not only for humans for all of human history, but for EVERY animal in all of the entire history of life on this earth. fagism and trannyism did not exist until they were invented by jews in the mid-2000s.4. niggers are 13% of the population, but commit 56% of the crime.

@WIR @PussySlayer @ArdanianRight @saga "Gun control" is exactly what it sounds like. It's about keeping the majority in line and dependent on authority.

@pea You have to cut off your dick and join the Muslim LGBTWIABC community.

@chara @ChristiJunior I wish my dad said racist shit about blacks...

@DetectiveHyde @ihavebigtits @sim They both accept the same basic premise that all are good and deserving of equal respect. That all ideas no matter the source are worthy of consideration.The only difference is that one side fights for the further degradation of society and the other side fights for the ability to degrade things only within their own home.The problem is once everyone thinks it's OK to do personally (see marijuana) it becomes acceptable and in fact "logical" to socialize.

@chara @ChristiJunior I just wish more of them would step up and call out the BS.For every guy like Steve King, there's another 10 denouncing (((racism))) and (((anti-Semitism))) who would be content to let their daughter get blacked and abused by a mudslime rather than defend her future.

@PussySlayer @MKULTRAdiamond @Nil01 @BugmanExtraordinaire The way of the PussySlayer is the way of the alpha male.If you don't dick down your girl he will.

@MKULTRAdiamond @Nil01 @BugmanExtraordinaire That easy, you go with the girl on the left because once you you force her to submit to your manliness any traces of feminism disappear. It's the only way to combat such a disorder.

One of the things that make your average Boomer conservative so dumb is that they're incapable of abandoning failed talking points. For example, they STILL say "Democrats are the REAL Racists" and "the Nazis were leftists", despite said arguments gaining no traction even with centrists. All it accomplishes is conditioning the Right to foolishly think that "Racism" is the ultimate evil, and that Nazis are more dangerous than Communists.You also saw this with the Benghazi obsession: It completely failed to damage Obama during the 2012 election, and even the movie based on the event was a borderline flop, yet the Boomer Right kept parroting that failed talking point that wasn't doing anything to hurt Obama. Idiots.

@cy @chara What good have trannies and fags done?

@chara Capitalism is Jew'd.

@DetectiveHyde @ihavebigtits @sim Remember, today's far left is tomorrow's hardline conservative.

@sjw Probably a bunch of fags. The only thing I've ever been banned from had so many TOS and rules that the communuty doesn't even talk anymore.

@jack I agree with your assessment of how (((authority))) carries way too much weight.I got a friend whose jwoke who still demands academ/gov sources to an exacting extent - it's a hard thing to break mentally. You can't rely on academia or the gov to tell you niggers commit disproportionate crime, you have to look at the data and run the numbers yourself.That being said, not everything that comes from authority is BS. It's impossible to lie about everything, the big lies would start to fall apart.

@chara The 9/11 is a little iffy. From what I've seen they did provide intel to the terrorists (indirectly) and did not give the US a heads up when they knew about the attack in advance - but didn't plan or execute the attack.That's grounds enough to hate them tbh.

@xeno @dogjaw Those are a lot of words for calling someone a fag.

@levi @yolo @dogjaw Another valid point by levi. How many hard drives of lesbian normalizing material do you gave?

@yolo @dogjaw WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU EVEN GETTING ALL OF THESE PICTURES WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU

@yolo @dogjaw @levi I'm beginning to believe that you're either developing a drinking problem or ca new strange persona.

@yolo @levi You know, what the left wants: people just shitting and pissing wherever, but together. Acknowledging the differences, of which there are none, because we're all the same in our endless #Diversity.

@judgedread @Oblivia @MKULTRAdiamond @WIR The real problem is there's no real investigative reporting done by the right, especially when it comes to policing abuses by other rightwingers. There's no demand for it either, since marks don't want to admit they've been duped, and there's more incentive for rightwing e-celebs to mutually ignore each other's grift until the dumpster fire becomes too obvious.

@rasterman @PussySlayer @comfy I didn't specify, but not all laws - mostly i intellectual propery, rights, and stuff like that.

@shit @orangesec_0 Depends. A big issue is the US produces 60% of the worlds guns and contains an even greater percentage.So you can almost eliminate them in countries like the UK, Japan, and Australia - all islands that don't produce many. But countries like Russia, China, US it's not happening.

@PussySlayer @rasterman @comfy Agreements are usually made between countries individually. That was a bad thing about the TPP - it basically made laws from one country applicable in all member countries.I'm not certain how it all worked, but it was some fuckery.

@mrsaturday I definitely don't want an anti-vaxx dr xD

@ZettaiRyouiki You've acknowledged that racial differences exist, as I recall, and I'm happy to leave it at that for now to discuss the more conceptual issues for now. Also, you say how "we need to move" beyond, but who are you asking? Those that come into our countries and impose their way of life on us, or us? A majority of Whites - in many cases a vast majority - in Europe and America want immigration ended at least short term. These are our countries, why do we have to provide preferential treatment to outsiders at our expense? Why should we adopt their customs? How is demanding any who join our society to adopt our way if life Nazism? If that's what it takes to be a Nazi I guess I'm a Nazi - my imagery was chosen as a mockery of that very viewpoint. You seem to be arguing for both integration and multiculturalism. These 2 things are incompatible.There is a large difference between an Irish and a Somali coming to our country. What time period in your opinion had tbe US flourished the most?

NPR TODAY:"A majority of black males will not take medical advise from non-black male doctors." Their solution: " We need greater diversity in the medical field. To do so we may need to change (as states LOWER) the requirements for med school for certain demographics. This of course is insufficient alone and they will need lower tutions as well.So since blacks refuse medical treatment from any outgroup we have to conform the system to meet their needs.  Remember, blacks have integrated just fine, and if you have a problem with an under qualified black doctor you're a #bigot. But they can demand their ingroup - AT YOUR EXPENSE!

@p @diresock Well then they're fags. Still technically works xD

@p @diresock That guys a fag. You should tell him such.

@humanpopcycle020 @ZettaiRyouiki @MKULTRAjr Well now you're going into the race aspect of it, which is fine. So long as you're up to it. But you do realize that in regards to rape White men are not the main offender? In fact, they are underrepresented by 10%, whereas Blacks are overrrepresented by 14%.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @p Like most MidWesterners I am polite until pushed. Then it's GTFO BITCH!

@humanpopcycle020 @ZettaiRyouiki That's not an argument. Don't divert to a hot topic thinking you can change the debate.

@Liberty4Masses You missed a couple.



@humanpopcycle020 @ZettaiRyouiki @MKULTRAjr No. I stated, inferred is what you did, that toxic masculinity does not exist. The traits used to describe it are not unique to men, nor particularly common. These are the traits of a psychopath/sociopath. Saying we have a problem with "toxic masculinity" using such a definition:A) Implies all/majority of men act/think like this wayB) Pathologizes Masculinity

@humanpopcycle020 @ZettaiRyouiki Sex is not ambiguous, it's either a noun or verb. Context can inform the reader which.Yes, so you mean a rapist. Those are criminals, they get convicted and go to jail or prison. That does not describe a majority of men.



@humanpopcycle020 @ZettaiRyouiki That's a pretty baseless accusation. You like to just attack; are you taking after our good friend @MKULTRAjr? What about my statement lead you to that?As for taking down an aggressor - you're spot on.

@humanpopcycle020 @ZettaiRyouiki First, gender is a word made to muddy the waters and obscure differences between the sexes, just use the word sex.To your point: Being unemotional is not human, I'll be damned if I don't tear up at a close family member or friend's funeral. Violence is not tolerated in our society - at least for the majority - and sexually aggressive? As in rape? Or as in how one acts in bed? There is a fine line between rape and someone liking it rough.You're literally describing a caricature. Show me the man man who fits this criteria and I'll show you a prisoner.

@humanpopcycle020 Did I say otherwise?

@ArdanianRight @levi @chara @MilquetoastQT @modfaggotry To be fair, you were treating the synagogue shooting as if 6 million Jews had just been gassed.

@yolo She has a pretty strong "notice me senpai" complex. TFW, Naofumi looks at bird girl with greater admiration than her is priceless!

@PussySlayerABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!

@ArdanianRight @rambeaucockius2 @ChristiJunior You guys need to stop taking this obvious troll bait.

@yolo It's a conspiracy! The DeepState has learned how woke we are. Don't worry #Q is in Antarctica hacking the secret fed servers now!download.gif

@PussySlayer WHAT?

@p @sjw Are you at least getting unrefined iron ore in exchange? Only a mad man would give away such valuable resource freely!

@ZettaiRyouiki @SRSB @vercingetorix @MKULTRAjr @orekix @humanpopcycle020 There is a large connection between IQ and success. Success - unless you happen to be related to Trump or Hilton - is very closely linked to IQ.Success is closely linked to some mixture of intellect and aptitude.

@ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 We're in agreement on your first 3 paragraphs.In regards to your last: I'm used to people freaking out on me and looking at me like I'm a monster for even suggesting their are differences among populations. You speak fairly similarly to them, so forgive my assumption.So we agree forced replacement is bad. But let me ask you, for the majority of Whites who want to see immigration drastically reduced within our countries, but are ignored due to the interests of other groups, how is this not being forced upon us? Do we not have a right to our own spaces, our own countries as much as anyone else?As for consensual breeding across races, there will always be some amount of that; and while I do not personally encourage it, I will not universally condemn it. That being said, as we import more and more people of different ethnic backgrounds into our country - with no say in the matter - who breed at a higher rate than us, how are we not going to become replaced? Will we not soon cease to exist? When you mix chocolate and vanilla (not meant to be overtly racial, just an easy analogy), you no longer have either - you have something new. At what point can a historically White [better put European descended] nation say no more immigration? When they become 50%, 30%, maybe 15% of the population?Furthermore, different people create different cultures, different groups have different aspirations, and as we live within a democratic system that means numbers are power. You are already seeing battles between Arabs/Muslims with Jews in the Congress of the United States. As a nation diversifies, arguments over ideas begin to take a back seat to arguments between groups. I want to live in the nation of my forefathers, not the hodgepodge that is being forced upon us. Progress is of course inevitable, but I don't see the erosion of my demographic, my people, and my way of life progress.

@ChristiJunior @comfy @ZettaiRyouiki @IsaacWestcott @humanpopcycle020  I think one big thing is divorce laws need to be reworked so that if there's a considerable gap in income between the two spouses, one should not be able to leave with half in a no-fault context. In the event of an abusive spouse maybe having to pay a pension makes more sense, but otherwise it doesn't.

@ZettaiRyouiki @vercingetorix @humanpopcycle020 Do you find the genetic replacement of Tibetans by the Chinese deplorable? If so why? They must have just been an out dated concept according to your logic.Do you find the diminishing number and displacement if Palestinians by Israel bad? Why? They are just being replaced by more people.Just because there will always be conflict doesn't mean measures shouldn't be done to mitigate them.Racial differences are very real. Are you telling me you think the only differences between people are culture and melanin? That there is 0 chance anything else is genetic?

@ZettaiRyouiki @vercingetorix @humanpopcycle020 First, you didn't contest my points.Second, a people who don't breed cease to exist.

@ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 This is my first blatant disagreement. As animals our biological imperative is to reproduce, that is not up for debate. Any man or woman who refuses to defend his or her offspring is the scum of the earth.

@ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 @vercingetorix You may be right in some cases, but clearly those least suitable to be parents are becoming increasingly represented among that population. Furthermore, have you ever considered who is targeted by the mass pushing of childless lives? White women. Go look for an article discussing how fertility and reproduction is negative for the environment and tell me when it doesn't show White children and/or sad or happy White women (depending on the context).Considering how wrapped up society is with #Diversity, you'd think there would be some among these advertisements.

@sarchasm Priests are celibate so they won't have any outside loyalties to their wife or children. In particular they won't try to transfer church property to their children, or found a dynasty within the church converting the Papacy into a hereditary monarchy.

@Oblivia Smoking is fucking gay.

@ChristiJunior @SRSB @Oblivia @Ralf Ok. That would be a case of tocic masculinity. But since they are a bunch of nogs it's just their disgusting nature.#NogSlayer

@ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 The biological purpose of a man is to spread his seed and protect his clan. Beyond that nothing matters. A female is similar, except it is her purpose to have kids rather than spread seed.As long as a man or woman accomplishes those 2 things he or she can do anything so long as it is not detrimental to those. There are ideal and complimentary roles both sexes (gender is a fake word) play in a vast majority of circumstances that are most efficient at accomplishing these goals.

@ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 I think it is very much a relevant question. A man who is unable to dominate an aggressor cannot protect himself or loved ones.What you're describing with these definitions sounds like a sociopath or psychopath. It is also describing behaviors not unique to men. According to your definition this is an exceedingly rare phenomenon and would also apply to females.However, "toxic Masculinity" is portrayed as innate in all men and something ass innocuous as an edgy joke or asking a girl out is said to be toxic (see the #gaylette commercial). Certainly, you don't view such actions as aggression attempting to dominate and intimidate to get one's way. If so you label being human as toxic masculinity.

@p @miya @nerthos @paul "Alleged holocaust denier" stated as if it is some grave sin. On par with sponsoring terrorism no less!

@chara @11112011 I wish the #MAGAtards were racist...

@rasterman @ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 @Leradvor It's important to establish terms and precedents that are to be involved in any discussion/debate.

@ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 Do you want your man to be weak, powerless, and in need of protection?That doesn't seem very beneficial to you as a female.

@ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 @Leradvor You don't believe in hierarchy do you?

@ZettaiRyouiki @humanpopcycle020 Define toxic masculinity then.

@humanpopcycle020 @ZettaiRyouiki Define toxic masculinity.

@diresock Too unpopular, far less popular than limiting immigration. He'll never do it.

@rasterman Why do you hate Jews?

@ArdanianRight @judgedread @diresock Young college students like her. That may help. Depending on how many professors are on board you could see grass roots support.

@diresock The Democratic coalition is under strict control.Notice that Black Lives Matter vanished when it became problematic.The dream of breaking their coalition is pure cope. Feminists and Muslims coexist in that coalition.Let that sink in.

@ArdanianRight @judgedread @diresock You're getting harsher on the cuck Webb. You grow slowly, but surely.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @diresock @judgedread @MKULTRAdiamond Also...why bother with blacks over our own? They have divergent interests and are generally unproductive.90%/40% of the Rep/Dem voter base are  white, respectively. Currently ~75% of voter base, set to shrink ~2-4% a cycle.Blacks are 4%/22% respectively.Should we go for 1/4 of 22% or 1/4 of 40%? Even ignoring other factors the choice is obvious.

@diresock @ArdanianRight @judgedread @MKULTRAdiamond 10% instead of 8% - not astounding.

@rasterman Especially with a Jew. The Jew will try to smear you to no end, keep it simple and straightforward so they look like a lunatic for not answering simple questions.

@judgedread @diresock Maybe sooner, depending on internal migrations as well.

Yeah, about diversion tactics: always insist on the main point, even if you look like you are repeating yourself. Sometimes it's necessary to avoid ending up discussing the straw-man or even something completely different.

#Baizuo is a derogatory Chinese neologism used to refer to Western #leftist #liberal elites support of #multiculturalism, political correctness and positive discrimination...the term is defined as referring to those who are hypocritically obsessed with political correctness in order to satisfy their own feeling of moral superiority motivated from an ignorant and arrogant Western-centric worldview who pity the rest of the world and think they are saviours.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baizuo

@SRSB I think you'd be interested in Self-Defeating Personality Disorder. Look into when you have the chance. Or don't. But I think you'll find it interesting.

@karolat @SRSB @xeno https://freespeechextremist.com/objects/e1b31cf7-a8ac-4076-9e8e-75a8c45abad4

@SRSB You're the one bringing up non profit bb

@karolat @SRSB @xeno Nor do I, but I find the responses of shilling for big pharma amusing.

@SRSB Strawman. Reading stats and making connections is not the same as trusting...whatever non-profit that you're referring to.

@karolat @SRSB @xeno It's not as amusing to be reasonable on this topic. The more extreme the more fun answers she gives.

@SRSB @xeno :0171: :0171: :0171: Have I pleased you?:0171: :0171: :0171:

@SRSB Not for those in psychiatry. And in pharma diversification is important, same for other interested investors and regulators.If there is 1 penny to be made per person, someone is going to get those pennies!

@SRSB That's because you're assuming good intentions. I'm operating on the only principle that matters in the world: profit.

@SRSB @xeno There's a new forn of lobotomy called lithium, it's much more gentle.

@SRSB Nor is it for you. So I suppose we have reached an impasse.

@SRSB There are ways to treat things without overmedication. Some people need it, yes, but you're not distinguishing.I don't hate it, you can't work with something you hate day after day - that'd drive anyone mad. But somehow I feel my real motivations would unnerve you more considering you find me twisted for not wanting to medicate children who will undoubtedly be diagnosed with this disease in mass.

@SRSB Ad Hom or Defer to authority. Do you watch Sargoy of Akkad?

@ArdanianRight @jack @WIR What?

@SRSB It's lobotomy lite. I'd advise you try it though. It may calm you down.

@SRSB Don't forget chopping off your dick! That's a new, mainstream and modern treatment.

@SRSB I thought you'd like the # TBH.

@SRSB The world is no more bengin. If you think that it is you're a fucking dolt. Children can be harrased and threatened on TV without consequence and sometimes with praise, people can be punished or fired for not calling someone a yellow lemon and "misidentifying" him, jobs lost for wrongthink, and kids medicated for acting out.The world us just cruel in different ways, we've just defined it as just. 50 years ago what we now see as repulsive was justified too.

@SRSB That's #snowflake logic. It's not medical, it's psychological. It's just different terms, dont be triggered.I'm actually the one advising against mass medication here - nice try. You're defending these large organizations against any scrutiny, am I supposed to take it that you aren't giving them too much a bebefit of the doubt considering the ADHD generation fiasco?Yes, when a disease is defined so vaguely, so broadly, and people defend it SO ADAMANTLY people are going to "trust the experts" FULLY and just down the drugs. Psychologist and Friends > PsychiatristsOvermedication is not good, you're a better big pharma shill than me, you should seek a marketing job within one.#LithiumIsTheNewLobotomy

@levi Stop posting #christcuvk memes and go to bed.

@SRSB If only. I know others. If you don't live life with a suspicion of the modern world you'll either live a short life or a long one as a slave.

@SRSB @BugmanExtraordinaire Don't combine my statements with others to make a strawman. I never said they don't exist and never cited a blog.You've convinced my big pharma, the field in which I work, is purely altrustic. As a token of piece would you be willing to test this formerly unprofitable drug on your kid? It'll give her confidence and make her not be afraid of things!

@SRSB What's that last part referring to? And no I'm not trusting a randi, I look at how similar situations have manifested in the past.It doesn't take a genius to realize any moderately expressive kid my age was diagnosed with ADHD and drugged. People got fed up and that's a less popular treatment. Now some obscure "splinter" condition with a different name and similarily vague wording appears and I'm to think the same shit won't be exploited for profit?

@SRSB @BugmanExtraordinaireWe're talking psychological, not medical. These are among the most exploited people in the world. Do you have an issue with companies like Monsanto pumping chemicals into your food? If yiu do you're a hypocrite fir not growing your own food instead.

@SRSB Sure...well just keep trusting the professionals, it'll work out.

@ArdanianRight @jack @WIR When offered to an outgroup leads to dead people. Honestly, we deserve worse than we are getting.

@ArdanianRight @jack @WIR Can you imagine Christian police? You see why idgf if violent means become necessary in tne future?I have 0 sympathy for leeches who cry if you swat them.

@ArdanianRight @jack @WIR Then there was that HPV incident NY which of course merited no investigation or attention. Can you imagine had that been a Catholic priest?

@SRSB Designer disease in the sense of definition. Things can be real and exploitable, look at ADHD, in that sense it is exploitable.The definitions of this are so vague there is 0% chance that it won't be exploited. Every kid who gets sad when disciplined is going to get a pat on the head and a trip to the psych office - many of them will get drugged.Keep thinking these organizations care.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @chara @Oblivia I thought the only thing that made me a man was my clothing.I live in eternal fear of mistakenly putting on women's socks and transforming into a woman. ALWAYS CHECK THAT LABEL!

@tessaracht So to non web developers what does this mean?

@SRSB @neptuna Then as long as big pharma money can just glass door through you're going to see overmedication encouraged.Roll out the red carpet for the next designer disease, bc people are dumb.

@tessaracht there's more to it than that!they ship an option that blocks ads and replaces them with their own ads. they use a cryptocurrency (???) called "basic attention tokens" to track how well their ads do. and, to top it all off: according to wikipedia, "In a future version of the browser, the company intends to adopt a pay-to-surf business model."

@chara @weeb #HailZion #IsraelFirst

@matrix #Winning

:backfromgab:

@orekix @levi Damn Fag! The wrong side won the war! If only he had moved to Mexico instead!

@SRSB @neptuna This is all true, but overmedicating is a big issue in psychiatry. Most people just believe anyone who is deemed an expert unconditionally.While our understanding of these issues do change overtime that doesn't mean we need to have every possible personality quirk made into a disorder. The definition of this disorder is so vague and expansive almost anyone could be diagnosed with it.I don't know if you're old enough to recall the ADHD craze, but literally half of my class - mostly all boys - were diagnosed as having ADHD. Acting out was tantamount to an ADHD referral followed by a psyc prescribing ritalin, concerta, etc. The definition of this disorder is about as vague as ADHD and could be "diagnosed" similarly.

Altruisms are racist.

@SRSB @MKULTRADEMONjr @neptuna All lot of it is definitely being abused, that's for sure. Psychiatrists are way quicker to medicate today than they were in the past.

@p上手ですね。日本のネイティブスピーカー見たいですよ。ありがとう、教えてくれました。私ちょっと下手ですね。

@p @benisnotreal @Oblivia @PussySlayer @WIR @MKULTRADEMONjr @jack @BugmanExtraordinaire That sounds good, may try it sometime. But I'd probably omit the beans and tomatoes if possible.

@MKULTRADEMONjr @SRSB @neptuna What? What kind of source is that?

@SRSB This clearly hits close to home. I'll just leave it be.

@jack @benis Pretending is indeed bad, but I don't think that delegitimizes the merits of being polite.

@jack But how do you quantify those within a politician? By what metrics do you make your judgement?

@karen Any Shinto traditions that you care to share in particular? I'd like to learn more about it too!

@jack How do 1,2,9,10 work into politics?

@benis @jack let Jack enlighten you to the true homosexual and depraved nature of the white man.Then join me in Ugandan Supremacism

@jack @benis What would you place in it's steed. Surely being overtly rude and aggressive isn't what you preach?

Diabetics just need to toughen up their pancreas. People with tuberculosis just have lazy lungs. Lymphoma is just a made up disease to sell cancer treatment.

@SRSB Also, as someone whose worked for  big pharma and university research, I know firsthand how many studies are sponsored by them.When 3 of your 4 million dollar research budget comes from someone like Pfizer, you're going to research what they want.No doubt most researchers have good intent, but being involved in this system, writing grants, looking for answers that your funders want - that's both real and over time depressing.

@SRSB It worked for me. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety when I was very young. I was given medications that gave me terrible side effects and made me feel worse. To be clear I tried multiple medications for each, and none worked.I decided to stop taking them and just take risks, challenge myself to sit still and quiet a little each day - and sought activities that rewarded patience, risk, or thought.Now I take no medication, and although the urges and symptoms manifest from time to time I have learned to control them or try to direct them (like the hyper activity) towards useful purposes.Good therapy and self control is oft better than relying on a substance.

⁣

@MKULTRADEMONjr @hardmaus @p @Oblivia @benisnotreal You posting ugly brown thots again? Look at that disgusting pube hair and brow!

@SRSB This sounds like a designer disease.This just sounds like an anxious person who refuses to be proven wrong.We can't just call every little personality quirk a disease or disorder. Sometimes you just got to tell people to get over themselves.I suspect there are already "treatments" involving medication being organized. I wouldn't doubt if a big pharma making said drugs wss sponsoring these studies.

@11112011 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior If we could somehow use this to incite Torba/Monster to attack the SPLC that'd be beneficial.It could possibly make the powers that be actually destroy him - which could be a turning point for some if these people.@judgedread @PussySlayer What do you 2 think?

@ArdanianRight @11112011 @ChristiJunior In fact - post that shit!

@ArdanianRight @11112011 @ChristiJunior I fucking hope so. If he wises up some #magapedes to the jews he's done well.

@11112011 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Nobody disputes that he sucks. We are disputing your source sucks.

@ArdanianRight @IsaacWestcott @11112011 I mean, just last week we saw Trump suck up to blacks, Latinos, women and ESPECIALLY Jews, while ignoring the White men who actually got him elected. He'll bring about prison reform for violent dindus and give Israel everything it wants, but heaven forbid his White male base gets any of what it voted for. Jim Webb might be trash, but most Democrats nowadays are straight up evil Traitors, and even most Republicans act like they desperately want their wives Blacked, so naturally he doesn't look that bad in the grand scheme of things.

@ArdanianRight @11112011 @ChristiJunior He's been bad since at least the early 2000s.

@ArdanianRight @11112011 @ChristiJunior He also supports removing confederate icology from all public spaces.He's just a more discreet Joe Biden. You're given him a pass bc he's WHITE and not overtly insane. That's the same mistake we make letting "moderate" Muslims in thinking they'll all assimilate and be as such.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @11112011 Literally, 90% of his policies prove that. IDGAF what lies or words he used to smooth it over.

@ArdanianRight @11112011 @ChristiJunior The guy feels REAL bad for niggers and gays, wanted to let loose tons of criminals, redistribute education funding federally not locally, every domestic policy was basically just: how can I improve the lives of nogs at the expense of everyone else.Fuck him.

@11112011 @ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior SPLC? I question this source if they don't describe how they got those numbers.

@ArdanianRight @11112011 @ChristiJunior It was long, long ago. It's just obvious now.

@karen You don't like the vibrant #diversity? Once we start replacing all the hit chicks with blue haired, black land whales wearing hijabis I'll be happy.

@11112011 @ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight I know and don't care. I'm mostly on Gab to troll and be blunt now. The platform is going down.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight Not to mention most of our crime stats put Mestizo in with White.Even still blacks make up 50%+ violent crime xD

@ArdanianRight @IsaacWestcott A lot of the crime- and social problems that Europeans and American leftists bring up to bash America and justify stuff like gun confiscation basically just boils down to the following issue.WokeHank.png

@ArdanianRight Hearing people talk about crime and never mention blacks is just so tiring.What's more annoying is peaceful, homogeneous areas either crying or stating thatva lack of diversity makes their area worse.Tbe #Diversity cult is such a joke.

I thought I was anti-Muslim but Boomers actually put me to shame there. Maybe they have to channel all of their hatred towards 1% of the US population because they're not allowed to say a single negative thing about blacks or Jews.

@ArdanianRight #DiversityIsOurStrength #Bigot

It's crazy to imagine that 96% of the population is dumber than me, because I'm absolutely fucking brain dead.

@matrix It's ok. Remember that many of them are making decisions that affect millions of lives everyday, including choosing who gets the nukes.Keep that in mind and you'll feel much more relaxed.

@mrmcmayhem @jack The destruction of the rail system is a mixed bag. On one hand undesirables are locked into urban areas, on the other we lost our cities.

@mrmcmayhem >car manufacturers destroyed the public systems by the 40sThere's a whole other dimension to the auto question. If you look into the failed auto makers list on Wiki you can see a lot of White men, genuinely White, who got sued either by the SEC or Jewish competitors over nothing and were driven out of the business in the 30s-70s. The regulations, the suburban planning, the racial dangers, the utility robber barons also have their own subversion stories.

@ArdanianRight @comfy I'll be voting for Obama during his 4th term come 2020.

@minitru I'll be a boss of sorts, so a bit different, but these look pretty cool so far. May aim for a few just for the experience.

@ArdanianRight @SRSB IMO, that is not necessarily undesirable. The only downside is the possibility of Russian/Chinese invasions or interference.

@SRSB @ArdanianRight I've discussed this idea with some people in my hometown. They actually agreed that we need to restrict interstate immigration. They feared Californians or Texans (basically Hispanics) would move in and start voting for shit policies. I'm not fully opposed to breaking down the Federal government in the long run.

@SRSB I find it hard to believe either, I'll investigate a bit. Again, this may be more effective in Europe than the colonies for multiple reasons.Ending the welfare state is definitely good no matter what. But in order to be equipped and prepared our people need to start having babies and stop feeling bad for minorities. In that regard we're a ways off.

@SRSB That's the biggest fucking White Pill I've heard in awhile! If you ever come across any evidence of that and post it I'll give you a virtual high five!

@SRSB I hope you're right. In our homelands, you may be correct, but as for the former colonies, excluding Australia, the demographics are a bit more bleak.

@SRSB True. But that is assuming a closed environment. The West has open borders.

@orangesec_0 I like how the leftist article has a White man with a knife, rather than a nigger like the article depicts.Mugging is more than theft, it is assault, and in many cases assault with a deadly weapon or intent to inflict harm.

Liberals say women should just “agree” to be robbed, mugged or raped, since self-defense is now BAD#news #naturalnews https://www.naturalnews.com/2019-02-10-liberals-say-women-should-just-agree-to-be-robbed-mugged-or-raped-self-defense.html

@SRSB I'm afraid once the Pandora's box of universal suffrage has been opened in conjunction with "social democracy" the only way for the system to be reformed is either with bullets or decentralization.Maybe someday, maybe someday.

@djsumdog @jack Globalization is good, but (((Globalism))) is bad. There is a fine difference.

@SRSB Agreed. Only married couples with children should get to vote, and it should be 1 vote per family!

@ArdanianRight @SRSB Women with kids are usually fairly conservative. Mothers shelter their children, but they often don't trust the state.It's the single, leftist women pushing a nanny-state and treating every mudskin int he world as if it were her child to compensate for her lack of self-fulfillment.

@IsaacWestcott what do you call a nigger at a libertarian/republican gathering?Keynote speaker.If I was a nigger I'd get a job fleecing those retards like candace "let my people go" owens

@orangesec_0 If we're lucky some epidemic will cut down these cities' population. ~90% of the muds live there anyway.

mainstream media keeps promoting vaccines, but nothing can save us from dirty 3rd world foreigners who carry diseases. But no one will listen to me anyways.

used to we actually invited foreigners that were, I don't know, even remotely clean. Now we just let them bring rare diseases and place them in heavily populated areas where then the diseases are not so rare.

@minitru The point of that: I guess I'm their nigger? xD

@minitru Since I'm being transferred to East Asia soon I've been doing corp research on some companies in Asia.Their diversity page is filled with White men. Liberalism is truly a disease, give it a century and you'll see the whole pacific go full US.It's given me some ideas as far as migration goes, but I'll know more after I've lived there a bit.

@minitru Drives me nuts that these fuckers fight so hard, possibly harder than Dems, for blacks.They worship these fuckers and will condemn their fellow just bc fuck all.

The point is that robust and durable social institutions might have moral standards, but will also have enough flexibility to deal with people living outside of the bounds of respectability. You can preach morality, but there needs to be a reasonable way to deal with private vices that don't rise to the level of social harm as universally recognized crimes like murder, theft, etc. There needs to be flexibility for dealing with stuff like drugs, extramarital sex, etc. in a way that encourages good behavior without destroying people for not being pure and holy.

@benis @ArdanianRight @comfy @jack @MKULTRADEMONjr @SexyGirl10830 @11112011 @judgedread You have nothing to add to any debate that goes against your preconceived ways.I'll wait a couple years wheb Catholicism embraces homosexuality and see you yell at me for being against fags.#ChristCuck

@ChristiJunior @benis @ArdanianRight @comfy @jack @MKULTRADEMONjr @SexyGirl10830 @11112011 @judgedread Regardless, Christianity is pretty useless moving forward.It hasn't prevented shit in modern history, and in many ways encourages it.

@benis @ArdanianRight @comfy @jack @MKULTRADEMONjr @SexyGirl10830 @11112011 @judgedread The New Testament. Jesus showed them pity and helped them. He treated them humanely.Harlots are only condemned and mocked in the Old Testament.

@benis @ArdanianRight @comfy @jack @MKULTRADEMONjr @SexyGirl10830 @11112011 @judgedread Prostitution was mentioned in the BIBLE multiple times, in a non negative connotation.It was not illegal in CATHOLIC EUROPE for centuries.Have you ever read the BIBLE or do you just blow Pope "Homosex is Moral" Francis?

@ArdanianRight @comfy @benis @jack @MKULTRADEMONjr @SexyGirl10830 @11112011 @judgedread The books are not that young always.New Testament wise many were written no more than a few decades after his death if that.THEY WERE COMPILED HUNDREDS IF YEARS LATER!

@benis @ArdanianRight Stupid things are stupid. I guess that's how this debate ends for you?Don't be an idiot like @levi you're better than that.

@benis @ArdanianRight I don't believe in moral relativity by any means. My definition is simple: if an act negatively impacts society or others, it is immoral. Also if a beneficial act is illegalized, the law is immoral.Regulating these activities will weed out the worst people in the most controlled manner, give outlets if people need, and be a good way to export bad habits to tourists to undermine their social norms for future exploitation.

@benis @ArdanianRight No. Because we may be operating on different definitions of morality.If we can agree on what we're debating it's more productive.

@benis @ArdanianRight Define immoral.

@benis @ArdanianRight Not Law Free! I'm not a filthy commie you fuck!WELL REGULATED AND LAWFUL WITHIN THAT ZONE ONLY! LICENCES, CHECKS, PROTOCOLS, ETC.DON'T IMPLY THAT I'M A COMMIE EVER AGAIN!

@ArdanianRight That's inelligible not intelligible.

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @benis @comfy @MKULTRADEMONjr @SexyGirl10830 @11112011 @judgedread Say you were making 200K - still a bad idea?

@ArdanianRight In all honesty well-regulated and controlled districts for vices could work.Any use of services or substances outside the district is harshly punished.Keeps it contained, keeps it from being exposed to kids, makes it easy to keep intelligible individuals out, can track who uses these services, and since every one innately knows why anyone is in that district removes much if the awkward social stigma.

@ArdanianRight Death Penalty? No sinner, No sin amir?

@ChristiJunior @ArdanianRight @benis @comfy @MKULTRADEMONjr @SexyGirl10830 @11112011 @judgedread My thing: if it becomes too profitable, won't the best women just do it?Maybe not the top of the top, but most above average chicks.

@ChristiJunior @yolo @weeb @levi @nik Family court needs revision, certainly, that could at least help with many issues. But attitudes need to changes, and some legal code corrections aren't going to end feminists or mgtow over night. People need to be less shitty.As @judgedread said: the media at large needs to be tackled. Would need some people at the top to change their minds or altmedia to take off.

@SexyGirl10830 You must be new to this profession. Good luck out there honey!

@ChristiJunior @yolo @weeb @levi @nik I don't know how many waves of feminism there are. Whatever the 60s one was. We're on like wave 9001 now, it's hard to keep track.

@SexyGirl10830 Can't see enough to decide if worth. Measurements? BHW? Because that nose isn't doing it.

@SexyGirl10830 @11112011 @MKULTRADEMONjr Nobody is free from taxation!

@yolo @weeb @levi @nik TL;DR porn means you get off alone and encourages isolation

@yolo @weeb @levi @nik I posted a whole thing on this yesterday. It seems to me a positive feedback loop.Back in the day couples didn't have porn if they argued eventually they'd want to fuck and all would be forgiven.Then came the sexual rev and porn - around the same time as feminism 2.0Both sexes felt they were right and when they fought instead if make up sex they could just fap instead of admitting fault - destroying marriages.Kids needed to be protected bc society cannot continue without kids and at the time women were mostly the primary caretaker and worked less (mostly still true) so then fam courts got fucked.Decades of that and you start seeing gays and mgtow appear - both don't need opp sex - no risk of divorce or commitment, both groups use copious amounts of porn. The sexes being now repressed (GenX onward do have less sex) are pissed, but still act like children bc porn can give immediate release and famcourt is still fucked. So here we are, surround by fags, soyboys, cucks, "strong independent whaymen", and all manner of insanity.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @BugmanExtraordinaire @MKULTRADEMONjr @Oblivia That's ethnocentric regardless. If I could have Americans focus whites here and be isolationist I'd take it. That'd be an improvement.

@comfy @ArdanianRight @PussySlayer @MKULTRADEMONjr @neptuna I only ever watched Sargoy of Akkuk for a bit. His accent is genuine, gutteral chuckle and all.But his main goal is to salvage liberalism - so in the end he never really refutes anything. He's just a more articulate cuckservative.

@ArdanianRight @comfy @PussySlayer @MKULTRADEMONjr @neptuna They criticize symptoms and glorify the causes. That's the main issue with that "community" of individualists.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior @BugmanExtraordinaire @MKULTRADEMONjr @Oblivia Leftist Jews still decry antisemitism though. Leftist whites, and even right wing whites, mostly don't do the same for antiwhite rhetoric.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior Alcohol?

@Oblivia @BugmanExtraordinaire once the modern society and welfare, government support systems crash, a return to an extended family household will be normal. This is why indians and chinese are taking over the West, because they live in an extended family household and thus they are able to save up tons of money

@orekix @matrix Faux Estrogen from that warm plastic amir?

@BugmanExtraordinaire @MKULTRADEMONjr @Oblivia Cultural and genetic. But according to cuckservatives that's ok bc we all bleed red and if the culture changes legally we'll just fail to conserve that too.

@ChristiJunior @11112011 @ArdanianRight Cuckservatives and Leftists are in effect undistinguishable.

@judgedread @rasterman @BugmanExtraordinaire @PussySlayer I'm still waiting for him to disprove the bunny prints outside my house on Easter!

@rasterman @judgedread @BugmanExtraordinaire @PussySlayer The West was dead the moment egalitarianism was born. Even in its infancy it allowed subversive tribes to thrive in its lands.Honestly, had the War for Reformation ended a Catholic victory all dissent: protestant and Jew alike would gave probably been eradicated.Since we lost the religious war we have to find what it is that binds us aside from MS Liberalism and make that the next war. It appears to be race, in which universalism need be our target.

@judgedread @PussySlayer @rasterman @BugmanExtraordinaire I like to imagine it's that latter option.

@rasterman @judgedread @BugmanExtraordinaire Liberalism was a mistake.

@IsaacWestcott @judgedread @BugmanExtraordinaire Too late. We're already lame shadows of our ancestors. We're like disabled people supporting gene editing to avoid more disabled people in the future, like the 8ch guy.That being said, agreed.

@neptuna Fact of the matter is most of them aren't worth saving. I know it sounds contrary to my aspirations, but I don't want a race of masochistic cattle.I'll not die on a hill to save such a useless clan. No politician can save them, no policies, no government because they won't allow it.As much as we sperg, including myself, about Trump not thanking Whites...why should he? Fact of the matter is he'd lose votes among all demographics including Whites. But he only stands to gain by praising others.I don't think there is a waking point until fleeing is impossible.

@WIR @judgedread @rasterman @MKULTRADEMONjr @ArdanianRight @Oblivia Probably so. God knows they'll never get trust busted

@neptuna Sounds like they need enrichment. I'm considering running as a Democrat come 2024 in my state if my current career path doesn't get to where I want it by then. I'll fight so hard to increase importing shitholers and fill the state with them.If Whites truly cannot drop the Liberalism they don't deserve to exist.

@WIR @judgedread @rasterman @MKULTRADEMONjr @ArdanianRight @Oblivia Just keep spreading the anti-big data message and scary stories about data breaches.People don't understand that shit and get scared. I've got most my family to avoid Google products and services now doing just that.Fuck Google.

@neptuna @forte It's also paramount to make any further white flight impossible. As long as they can flee, they will not fight.The issue is they are able to remove themselves from reality.

@neptuna @forte I think we need to start mass settling refugees in the North East between the cities and suburbs.We should give sction 8 housing to LA county residents in rural areas across the Mid West too.If they won't wake up, they'll get killed by the replacements. It's a win win really.

@SatisfactionGuaranteed It means it's been politicized. Like everything.Murder us not censored, but porn is. How is that not fucked up?

@yolo Only fire can cure these fags.

@PussySlayer @SatisfactionGuaranteed I'm torn on the porn issue. I get the concept of free speech, but it appears a lot is done to be dehumanizing, demeaning, and downright degenerate.There used to be standards on this shit and the advent of porn coincides with a lot of ills in our society, that's no coincidence - they feed off eachother.Porn leads to less need to seek partner, leads to less compromising in relationships, less stable relationships, reforming of family court under the guise of protecting children, these become super antiman so MGTOW forms, whose adherents use porn to replace sex and lash out at women, who in turn turn to the state to settle issues.Sure it's not the only issue here, but theres clearly a positive feedback loop between all this shit.

@SatisfactionGuaranteed Don't censors kind of prove some content is seen as offensive? If it needs to be censored, someone finds it offensive. If it's uncensored, at least the left doesn't find it offensive.

@chara @neptuna @SatisfactionGuaranteed @Oblivia @slickpockets @WIR I'll have to make a detailed list sometime, abriged it's roughly:T1 NW Euro (not irish) and Germanic; T2 Rest of Central Euros(the West Slavs), French, and Northern Italians; T3 Meds, East Slavs and Irish; T4 South Slavs and AlbaniansGreeks depend regionally. Parts are still very true to the great greece if old, but parts have been ravaged by the slavs and turk much of this millenia. The same is true for the Iberians - except the moors not turk and slav. There was also that botched inquisition where they let the Sephardic Jews live if they "converted."

@chara @neptuna @SatisfactionGuaranteed @Oblivia @slickpockets @WIR Well there are High Slavs (West: Poles, Czech, Slovene), Mid Slavs (East: Russian, Ukrainian, Etc), and Low Slavs (Southern).The Baltic peoples and Finns are actually most closely related, genetically, to Hungarians and Native Siberians (who the Russians managed to integrate genetically near completely in just a few generations).I'd put High and Mid Slavs above the Irish, but Southern Slavs below.The potato niggers are definitely not the best, but Serbs are a special kind of retarded and a lot of them are cucks to Islam.

@p ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!

@yolo @xeno That's just empty rage. Still love you. Can I has my head back?

@yolo @xeno FUCK YOU I HAVE! BUT IT WAS 12 YEARS AGO!

@slickpockets @chara @WIR @Oblivia @SatisfactionGuaranteed @neptuna You ever seen a nigger?

@chara @neptuna @SatisfactionGuaranteed @Oblivia @WIR @slickpockets I've always tallied them as Tier 3 Whites, right above Tier 4 Whites - the Slavs.People get butt hurt on the tier system though so I avoid it. Nature will see that order is restored once this unnatural "equalizing society" has ended.

@IsaacWestcott @chara @neptuna @SatisfactionGuaranteed @Oblivia @WIR @slickpockets There isn't a way to probably explain what you want to to your Jew. S/he/xir is probably hopeless in that sense. Have I rambled about my Noahide Law theory to you yet? Basically, there's a meta-Judaism that is not just the 7 main commandments for goyim and the 7000 dietary/lifestyle laws for Jews, but the whole construct of an illegitimate law system that they plan for everyone on Earth to be subjugated to. That's one piece of this kind of "appeal to (((authority)))" your workjew brings up. It has a religious foundation. (((Authority))) appoints (((authority))) and it can do whatever it wants (like kill your burglar, and probably your dog). But YOU are not a sanctioned (((authority))) and so you can't kill your own burglar (and if you do, YOU'VE committed a religious heresy you don't even know about and will be significantly punished for it). And the burglar can be punished for burglaring, a small heresy against the religion, but you aren't sanctioned according to this corrupt law system to impose any kind of punishment yourself. It's a whole rabbit hole.

@neptuna @slickpockets @WIR @SatisfactionGuaranteed No Jews.

@slickpockets @chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed @WIR Lol. I may visit Australia while away on this job. I know some peeps in Perth.

@slickpockets @chara @WIR @Oblivia @SatisfactionGuaranteed @neptuna You would rather live in a neighborhood of multiethnic contrarians, and sub 80iq niggers, than fellows who won't argue every little syntax or stab you in the night?

@IsaacWestcott @WIR @slickpockets @Oblivia @SatisfactionGuaranteed @neptuna social cohesion must be enforced by the in-group members, by any means necessary, if it is to be maintained. that's how it's worked in every clan and tribe and neighborhood and town in human history. community members must stick together, help one another out in times of need, protect each other from threats from within and from without, and propagate shared values and traditions within the community.

@slickpockets @neptuna @WIR @chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed @Oblivia I watch him sometimes so I know how Jews speak. I can spot the kikes well now.

@slickpockets @chara @WIR @SatisfactionGuaranteed I can be a contrarian. I debate myself and do devil's advocate with close friends. But doing it to acquaintances and strangers is not much more thsn trolling imo

@slickpockets @chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed @WIR Currently a college town, but I'm getting transferred overseas soon.

@slickpockets @neptuna @WIR @chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed @Oblivia You're talking about a strawman echi chamber.I suggest right wing. Trust me, our types will fight #MAGAPEDES all day. A right wing echo chamber has merit. It can be used to refine ideas in an environment not filled with gender illness.

@slickpockets @chara @WIR @SatisfactionGuaranteed A contrarian disagrees with everyone, I'm not surprised.

@IsaacWestcott @WIR @slickpockets @SatisfactionGuaranteed i want NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS, not NOBODIES AND FAGGOTS

@chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed @slickpockets @WIR I hope we can have that neighborhood someday.I for the most part agree, I get enough stress from these fucks IRL. If I want a debate various other platforms exist.Besides, most of us have differences on a multitude of issues already.It's not like we circle jerk all day.

Rant 20190208v002.1I write this ode to praise the ideals of a right-wing echo chamber.Mainstream Western culture is a left-wing echo chamber, the media, entertainment, a majority of normie thoughts, even our food as it us pumped with chemicals and jew codes! Living in the West is living in leftist thought.Inviting them into our space gives them more of our mind, more of our thoughts, and more of our energy. We know their arguments, their aspirations, and ideals. But do we truly know ours? We know facts they refuse to acknowledge, but alone what does this accompish? We have no unified ideals other than our posterity; and while that may be enough fundamentally, we still have a long way to go. Everyday we hash out ideas, debate, yell, and lol. Is introducing leftists into our hallowed library truly what we need to do? Do we need more stress, anger, and socialist views? Do we need more anti-White hate? Do we deserve these fuckers a voice?The West is a left-wing echo chamber, why make our space one too?

@jack Not bad. Do share after a month.

@chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed @slickpockets @WIR Those are valid points as well. I get enough leftist faggotry IRL. But I also enjoy sharpening my wit. It helps me torment leftists IRL, which does bring me great joy.

@ArdanianRight I honestly just think he's a sub 115 IQ guy who makes poor choices.He's the definition of nature's sergeant and he's in the role of an officer.

@WIR @chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed @slickpockets Fair points. But I think there are benefits to a right wing echo (debate chamber). I argue with people here and we all grow and refine our ideas.The fediverse may be able to serve both purposes.

@WIR @IsaacWestcott @chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed great words spoken.If i am going to be frank, i think the worst thing a partisan person can do, is betray their thought patterns to another, and i find this happening more and more in our days,now maybe im just reading far into insignificant things, but i find, when examining how someone speaks about another group (not individual, altho it is possible) in a public environment, like here, or even worse, in a broadcast enviroment, like in a speech or something. they will allways be truthful about their intentions, not directly, but indirectly by betraying them thru what i think they would consider is very cleverly worded sophistry, like hedging or lies of omission or various other debase forms of discourse.for example the new brazilian president often will hedge alot of his statements referring to "good" people, instead of all people. he does it almost endlessly, even during his inauguration speech he said (and im paraphrasing from memory of course) "i will enact laws for the good people of this country"another excert i found online on the guardian in an article:He also referred to campaign promises such as freeing up gun possession. “Good citizens deserve the means to defend themselves,” he almost allways refers to good people when justifying any action. this is what those who are familiar with the philisophy of war call: divide and conquer.or as von clauzwitz once said: war is the continuation of politics thru other means.

@jack He's still funny sometimes, but his GOP cheerleading sickens me.If someone does something good praise it, but really he's choosing Lindsey Gayhram? Of all people to blow xD

@slickpockets @WIR @chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed Good insight. Upon reflection I like him more.

@comfy @judgedread @ArdanianRight @Oblivia Little is the kind of guy that makes people optics cuck. While he himself doesn't preach violence a lot of spergs take what he says 200% seriously.It makes people who could otherwise be effective avoid real solutions and seek "safer" routes.

@yolo @igeljaeger fags r ghey

@WIR @chara @SatisfactionGuaranteed @slickpockets Too much variance of opinion and you'll get nowhere and just debate all day.At some point you have to believe you're right.Besides we have plenty of disagreement within our own corner: #opticsCucks, #stormFags, #conspiriTards, and truly enlightened people - like me.:0460:

@matrix That's true facts there. Whites cucks need to step up their game.

Goodnight All.

@BugmanExtraordinaire @Oblivia YW

@BugmanExtraordinaire @Oblivia Fucking nigger!

When it comes to #optics and the enemy of our people, remember this: The dishonorable man has no care to represent his opponent's idea faithfully.

@ArdanianRight What you are preaching is civic nationalism.Those low IQ peeps as you call them are winning, because we include them while they don't include us.You clearly see in group preference as immoral.

@ArdanianRight As an addendum, it is more important to focus on your people rather than exceptions from other group. This is energy better spent elsewhere.If the exceptions are truly on our side they can act on it and publicly speak against anti-White BS. That will not go unnoticed, but there is no reason to risk letting them into key posts within your own movement.

@ArdanianRight I never said go out and shoot people. Why are you so hung up on a few dead Jews? Who gives a fuck about them, they are probably boiling in feces down in Hell - like their good book says of Jesus.Our outgroup preference was never like this until recent history. It is social conditioning and media, simple as that. At this point retaking culture making institutions is not effective enough - too slow. Hence we need to create the social pressure necessary to break the out group preferenced conditioning.If you believe this outgroup preference is so engrained, just give up now. Go mix with your preferred minority and assimilate, because it's already game over then. We're just place holders in the game, meant to be replaced by the real player's pieces.

@chara @yolo Why is the limit that low? I have an absurd 2k limit.

@ArdanianRight First, is it effective to look for exceptions? I don't think all blacks are bad, does that mean you should move into a black neighborhood and welcome a vast influx of Africans? I guess Macron has it right. This #NAXALT mentality is why we lose, while we waste time searching for exceptions the rest are shooting us. You are showing sympathy to an enemy tribe, who collectively are fucking your people - the battles ahead are ti be determined by groups, not individuals. We will win or lose accordingly. Second, the traits that were exploited by Jews and made into a weakness rather than strength - "universalism" as you put it? What traits in specific?

@ArdanianRight You can't humanize and sympathize with enemies who don't reciprocate. You're doing exactly what you just spoke against.I'm against violence, because it is not effective in our current environment. But supposing it were to beciome the most effective method...well then that changes. [Hence I'm not advocating for violence, fuck you feds]At the end of tbe day victory and survival are all that matter, everything is a tool used to keep us masses in check.

@Prodigal If Whites weren't a bunch of effeminate cucks they'd stop voting for the GOP.This thought that some magic happens at 40% or lower is absurd. It's why the Americas are lost as is much of Europe. When it happens I hope the new denizens are brutal as possible.

@jack That's the wisest thing that I've ever seen you say. Thank You.

@IsaacWestcott IMO, the most healthy thing a lot of younger White people could do at this point is to let go of the picture of life that Hollywood and Boomer parents painted. It was a falsehood and we won't get to see it. Once people can do that, they'll start seeing more clearly and make more sensible decisions.

@ArdanianRight Stop being hung up on that shooting. There is no sympathy for Jews. You already know my views on it so don't strawman.Balkanization is only going to happen via civil strife, including but not necessarily war. That will only happen when we start fighting for ourselves and stop virtue signaling or looking to the powers tgat be for solutions.The ler40% society will lead to thus, because niggers and spics are economic drains. Waiting for there to be more of them is stupid. Push hard now. You don't have to yell 1488, wave a Nazi flag, curbstomp niggers, or even shoot the precious Jews, like you keep bringing up, to push pro-white solutions.Less Whites are full on leftist than you think. There are tons of libs, yes, but the anti-white shit is scaring them, and the overt Zionism is pissing them off too. Make it clear: this is our country, we're not a platform for your global social experiment, piss off. If that cannot be said: with our history, our founding documents, our non-Jewish immigration acts, our culture, etc. Then we have already lost.My only hangup with your argument is your cucking to Jew morality. Don't accept bigotry, racism, etc as bad. Any society that supersedes this one needs to be ultra xenophobic. We don't have the numbers to allow for mistakes on the world stage. The entire European ethnic group needs to act like the Japanese.

@chara Where is this from? The CDC?

Boost if you hate jews

Tip of the Day:Pat Little may be autistic, but he knows that if you follow Jews rules you lose.Don't be a cryptojew, ignore their morality and attack their falsehoods with real arguments.

@yolo Instruments of peace I see.

@yolo Why? Are you hiding something?

@chara Any good vineyards nearby? My ex-fiance loved those.

@ArdanianRight I know how to moderate IRL, and most lib Whites (not leftist) are tired of this shit too.If you really think electing gaslighting cucks is the way forward you're wrong.Trump was possible bc of Obama. Whites were pissed, he is placating us en mass.Trump is the LAST CHANCE for a political solution. If he doesn't limit immigration that's it.If he builds the wall w/o cucking on anything I'll vote him again, if not I will not - it's that simple. DEMAND RESULTS. RHETORIC IS NOT ENOUGH

@ArdanianRight It's been a failed strategy for years. If civil war broke out lefty whites would die first anyway.Leftist whites aren't your people. They are traitors. Traitors are to be trusted less than straight up enemies.The reason there is no hope for a slow White politics is bc: politics.As we shrink they will cuck more and explicitly seek other groups.Best case scenario with your plan is a terrible society where various ethnic groups seek coalitions to exploit state power every cycle like a parliamentary system. That fucking blows.We aren't going to keep all of the US, that's the hold up. Give it up, we've lost that. There is no way but balkanization moving forward. Leftist Whites are right up there with Jews as public enemy number 1.You think they'd survive a civil war? Seriously? Whites were just as tribal prior to the cultural revolution. This is another misconception. We're young, it's all we've experienced, but whites were nit always non-tribal creatures.If you just concede that the current system is unbeatable, then just give up on it all and go watch normie news and normie shit. Because this system is rotten beyond repair.

@ArdanianRight Civil War > Your le40% identity politicsOur strategy needs to be vote White if it's openly pro-white, or else write in someone you know who is. The time to slow ball this was 40 years ago, and our predecesors failed.Trying to work purely within a system THAT EXPLICITLY HATES YOU is foolish. I agree that we need to work the system, but not within it's parameters. No more free votes for cucks. After Trump's speech I'll never vote GOP again - unless tbe candidate is EXPLICITLY PRO WHITE. Until a candidate caters to me how they all do to niggers he can go fuck himself.

@ArdanianRight Everything about this reminds me why I hate my own people now.Collectively we are so fucking weak and cowardly. If I was a god I'd cheer our demise, becauses bitches get stiches.We care more about others than our own. We care more about perfect optics than survival. Looking good is more important than winning.Meanwhile the niggers commit violence against us at 10x the rate, hispanics flaunt our laws, Jews take our money and flood us with these beasts and we just try to be nice. THAT'S WHY WE ARE FUCKING LOSING!

@wowaname @p @yolo @xenoTusky_1549587782105_8RET3T4DRS.…

@Prodigal 90% of Trump's base is White. He just thinks he can win over the nogs by palpating their balls as they thrash his wife.

@ArdanianRight Wait until we are at a numerical disadvantage, what a strategic genius.This is why conservatism has failed. You and they are so worried about looking like the bad guy that you'd hand your nation over. In that case vote for all D and open these borders up. By the time we are 40% - 2/3 of whites will be over 30 and less than 20% under 20. That's abysmal compared to the others.The military will be more integrated, the minority population barring immigration will grow to 70%+ by 2070 - how is waiting until we can stalemate good? That's literally retarded.The answer is White identity politics now. If a Republican doesn't explicitly go pro-white you vote 3rd party or Dem. Your idea basically just relies on hoping the other groups are so divided a civil war occurs BY WAY IF THEM - SO THEY CAN LOOK LIKE THE BADDIES.That's weak thinking. Losing over half the country is dumb on so many levels.If eveey fucking channer, every little incrementalist would just agree to write in someone like Nehlen he may not win, and the Republican would certainly lose, but it'd send the message: WE NEED CHANGE NOW.

@comfy Farmer TorbaTusky_1549586001823_JZWRYHJBT1.…

@ArdanianRight The US as a stable entity is over. Trump isn't stopping and is likely not going to slow this decline.He's making the right-wing focus Zionism and money...I had faith for awhile but he praises everyone but his own base constantly and trades our interests out for every other group.

@ArdanianRight @chara And who promotes the idea that we are all the same? THE FUCKING JEWS!We didn't have this idea before itvwas introduced into our education systems, media, academia, and advertising for DECADES ALL BECAUSE OF JEWS!Prior to the (((cultural revolution))) 90% of the "people" pushing this shit in these sectors were JEWS. The others were paid off shabbos goy who wanted a quick buck and easy ride into academia.

@miya @chara Can't it be both? Master-Blaster is a 2 part deal.

@ArdanianRightWell good luck as a #CivNat, Trump is showing us exactly why that doesn't work.The point is operating on the premises the powers that be and their (((handlers))) provide. If we assume what they say is bad is bad, and just try to divert elsewhere or virtue signal we lose.Try debating against immigration w/o race and you lose. Trump's willing to now increase shows that, Tucker's debate vs Cenk showed that - I mean Tucker lost to that dumb fucking Turkroach, he's way smarter than Cenk, but he closed the door on race and had to cede any points where it was brought up.

@chara I hate the argument. Who gives a fuck who did the slave trade? It was a fucking economic system.The problem was allowing obsolete farming equipment - like Torba - the right to vote.We'll never win if we follow all their rules and morals. Running from (((racism))) is what got us here.

@ArdanianRight @chara @judgedread @Oblivia @comfy The real problem with these shooters is they think they'll make a difference, when in reality they just get everyone else cracked down on and garner the kikes public sympathy.He got what, 10 jews? Even 1000 Bowers wouldn't be enough - that'd be like 10,000.For his tactics to be effective there would need be 10000x more Bowers - and even then all the important/powerful Jews would still likely be safe.I shed no tears for them - God knows they laugh as it happens to us on the daily, but I wish Bowers had focused his resources on something thst could have had a bigger impact.

So all the deaths of American Troops and foreign fighters and civilians are for nothing except some Congress members' pride of saying they did something. War is all hell.

@PussySlayer @SatisfactionGuaranteed I don't think I've ever eaten at a fried chicken restaurant come think of it.

@PussySlayer @dogjaw basically synonymous, upstate is powerless

@TransRiley @IsaacWestcott you should respond by repenting so that you aren't sent to hell or will be saved when God brings his wrath down to the earth once more

@IsaacWestcott @TransRiley @yolo Just to be clear, the overwhelming majority of people currently being "nice" to trannies by using preferred pronouns and pretending they're the sex they claim to be are lying, and they know that they are lying:https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/want-to-date-a-transperson/"Virtually all heterosexuals excluded trans folks from their dating pool: only 1.8% of straight women and 3.3% of straight men chose a trans person of either binary gender. "So much for transwomen are women, period.

@ChristiJunior @TransRiley @yolo This justifies TERFS. Twice as many men? Morally weak fucks!

@yolo @ChristiJunior @TransRiley I knew we he didn't call me for "misgendering"

@ChristiJunior @TransRiley @yolo He must be a troll. It's too forward and too polite. Your point remains valid regardless.

@TransRiley @yolo Well some people are retarded, just like this convo.

@TransRiley @yolo While there may be no true 100% correct interpretations of reality, some are objectively more correct.Your's ranks in the 0th percentile.

@TransRiley @yolo Your genetics say otherwise.

@TransRiley @yolo That logic is dumb and retard. Are the voices scyzos hear real?

@TransRiley @yolo Gender dysphoria is a real issue. It a mental issue caused by a multitude of factord. Bombarding one's self with unnatural quantities of hormones has a disastrous effect on the body and oft times regret after transitioning can be a physical reminder of choices poorly made.

@TransRiley @yoloPeople who "transition" commit suicide at the same rate as those who don't.Invest your resources improving yourself: exercise, learn a trade/skill. You can't be a woman, even if you get some false bits your very being knows it's a lie.

@ArdanianRight @jack @sarchasm @ChristiJunior Pat did call out the Jews on live news when he ran. They got scared and quickly moved on.

@jack @sarchasm @ChristiJunior Pat Buchanan's about as solid as they come in terms of principled pro-White figures in American politics in the past 50 years. In general if you're a right-wing figure who's going out and smearing him, that's a pretty good indicator that you're a snake.

@QA I'm partial to shoulder cuts, they tend to be more meaty and less fatty - which is easy for me to prepare.But when I go out I like New York Strip.

@chara Maybe married women.Women tend to treat the nation like a family, however, single/childless women end up feeling good helping the most "vulnerable" members of society and lead to a state similar what we are experiencing.If only married women with children voted we'd probably have a pretty stable society: limited war, limited welfare state, etc.I don't know if it would be best for crime though...so maybe just married folk with children in general?

@chara Steak is my favorite meat, but from time to time a nicely cooked fish can be a treat.

@jack @WIR @rasterman the younger generations are feeling very alienated in western society now. I keep reading articles that mention anywhere from 30% to 50% of people 35 and under want to leave the West

@chara Salmon. I'm going to try a new lemon/mint seasoned salmon tomorrow.

@chara Good. Shopping at the fish mart. You?

@SatisfactionGuaranteed Except my side. Becauses I'm right and I'm riding up the Y axis.

@sarchasm @ChristiJunior Why would he even mention it? The story seems sketch to me.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJuniI realize this contradicts what I was saying w/o explicating a bit more:Segregation into connected, yet stable ethnostates would likely lead to a rise in tribalism, but if exposure and exchange is done slowly in this way "xenophobia" - in the negative sense - may yet be usurped instead by an interest in the various flourishing cultures.Obviously, not all cultures will be equal in such a scenario. Also, it requires too many non-subversive intelligent people to sacrifice a lot to pull such a feat off so...yeh worthless hypothetical.

@rasterman @ChristiJunior What?

@ArdanianRight I'm still thinking of a good way to get him to reveal if/how much he's invested into Gab as a brand.It'll be interesting to see his response.

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior There's a lot to it: genetic, cultural, etc. Outbreeding alone wouldn't fix it - in fact mass outbreeding would ultimately result in multiple "new tribes" with no rooted history and thus new, possibly more disastrous struggles.

@dielan @miya @yolo @wowaname @DetectiveHyde Way too many words to call someone a fag. Amusement Levels: 3/10

@ArdanianRight @ChristiJunior After a few hundred or so years of forced exposure tribalism could technically fade from a majority of people.Unfortunately we don't have the demographics to weather even 20 years.

https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/why-we-cant-talk-about-race-liam-neeson-repentance/It amuses me how Normiecons are now willing to condemn anti-white hate from the left and anti-white double standards, but can't come up with any sensible countermeasure because they loudly, hysterically, reject White Nationalism.Because they reject White Nationalism (aka, Whites displaying the same kind of in-group preference as every other group) they've embraced Unilateral Disarmament. They can't tell Whites to organize to defend their interests, they won't honestly address non-white immigration and how it is harming Whites, and they certainly won't reevaluate the insane anti-racist ideology that will turn White people into a despised, disenfranchised minority in the West if left unchallenged.Rejecting White National out of hand leaves the #cuckservatives without the necessary intellectual tools to understand, let alone fight, what's currently going on - they're like dogs barking because of loud fireworks, scared by something they can't comprehend.

@MKULTRADEMONjr @neptuna @PussySlayer @ArdanianRight No. Then you are doublefucked. That's like being in the Ministry of Truth - you're watched more closely bc they know you know things!

@PussySlayer @neptuna @ArdanianRight Is waterfox the comodo one? I hated that browser.Brave/Firefox are my preferred.

@neptuna @ArdanianRight A VPN will help if you want to torrent movies, or if you want to be xtra safe from potential snoopers at yr local coffee shop.The reality is, that it does next to nothing for privacy because a simple IP address is not a particularly useful metric. Most people who want to track you use fingerprinting to identify you as a unique signature online. It involves everything from your browser, your OS, screen resolution, fonts installed, the list goes on and on. Its very hard to detect and very hard too avoid. A VPN does nothing to mitigate any of that.

@neptuna Yeh. If I use a VPN I'd like to have as much, if not all, personal information to be detached.I assume there is one out there that takes crypto - if there is any incentive to get into it there it is.Thanks for the info I'll check it out!

@PussySlayer @judgedread @WIR @ArdanianRight I hate the Android forces you to keep google installed. Every update tries to sneak loc tracking back on too (as if i can rly turn it off..but still).If I understood more about mobiles I'd look into an alternative phone OS.

@PussySlayer @judgedread @WIR @ArdanianRight I use an old proprietary GPS, from before the days of jewggle. It's so old some roads don't exist. Yeh for old tech!

@ArdanianRight @comfy @EchoSierraTwo @PussySlayer I think the difference is intent. Torba may be a scam artist, but he's still a goofball at heart - and possibly a little idealistic.Monster is a stereotypucal scuzzy businessman, trying to latch onto a potentially new counter culture and ride it to profit.

Turn on NPR this morning, every story revolves around niggers.You'd think we lived in Wakanda. Every single story is about X racist action, X bad White, how some legislation which was aimed to help them and cost millions like all the previous didn't - so of course we need to dump more.Blacks are the fucking priest-class of the US. Look at one wrong, that's a lynching, speak too quickly, that's Whitesplaining, etc.I think this is going to have to be incorporated into Tip of the Day.TL;DR: The US feels so bad for niggers.End racist rant.

@levi @yolo Well there may have been some truth to it.

@Fabioandthefabulousfappers @MKULTRADEMONjr @miya @PussySlayer @jack Technically, the genus "homo" is man; so even Homo erectus would be of mankind. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if we find out what we consider modern day "Homo sapiens" turns out to be more than 1 species.There was an article from, I believe, the University of Michigan stating that orangutan were closely related enough to Sub-Saharan Africans and thus possibly worthy of the genus "Homo."The ability to breed across species isn't all that uncommon, and branches can diverge quite a bit. Miscegenation could truly be breeding a bunch of fertile mules.

@PussySlayer @WIR @MKULTRADEMONjr I'm loading just fine. Maybe u just ghey?

@1w4kvra @PussySlayer I think he got bear maced in the face prior.

@mrmcmayhem melting pot was a Jewish myth invented after the turn of the last century spread to validate Jewish immigration and eventually Zionism. At no point in America’s history previously was there any self identity as a “melting pot”. It was more or less explicitly a white ethnostate, banning all non western European immigration, which was an institution only seriously eroded in the 1965 immigration act which was not voted on by the American people.

@miya @mrmcmayhem It's really apparent to anyone who even reads any of our past immigration legislation and policies.

@1w4kvra @WIR @PussySlayer This sounds no different than the neocon/neolib dichotomy.

@PussySlayer @WIR @jack True. But consider that the funders had enough faith that the messages started there could seep into mainstream - as it had been doing for years.This is likely one of the most concrete shifts in the overton window that we've seen. It means they may be preparing for a Trump win. What that means for 2020 I don't know, but I think come primary season we will have some better insight.Consider how Breitbart is mainstreaming now.

@pFucking degenerate fluride guzzling Jew. Go back to China!

@PussySlayer @WIR @jack I was talking about journalist layoffs. It could be a precursor for the powers that be attempting to hijack populist energy.Unlike many I don't think Trump is disingenuous - Israel lover or not - but I think it makes the populist movement open to coopting.

@DetectiveHyde I think a strip search would be in order - can't be too SAFE.

@chara Mine has been acting up for a couple days. Someone's fiddling.

@WIR The government just sucks the fun outta everything.

@PussySlayer @WIR @jack Speaking of government/deepstate what do you think of the behind the scenes funding shifts in regards to media?

@PussySlayer Now that's some code!

@PussySlayer Looks like a shitty notepad. I'm going to go watch a video to correct this ignorance a little.

@PussySlayer Got Sublime installed. See what thw hub ubs be.

@PussySlayer @slickpockets @WIR @judgedread @MKULTRADEMONjr I'm going to check out this covert cobalt at some point.I'm too mych a fucking newb to make use now. Onto my Juptyr book and shit.

@DetectiveHyde If you have Mint there is a default software manager install option.

@PussySlayer @slickpockets @WIR @judgedread @MKULTRADEMONjr You hacked the hackers? You been talking your shit all over the internet - they gonna find you!



@MKULTRADEMONjr There is a disturbing amount of logic behind that statement.

@slickpockets @WIR @judgedread @MKULTRADEMONjr @IsaacWestcott Something like this. https://www.cobaltstrike.com/

Made the mistake of listening to NPR in my car. Of course the topic was feeling bad for niggers - in relation to sportsball (football).A direct quote "...these disadvantaged black and brown kids are weighing the negatives of abstractions, lile brain damage, some years down the line for more concrete things - like attending college."In what world is brain damage abstract and attending university concrete in comparison? Of course the moral was sink more money into these communities, so we can bankroll poor choices.#SuperBowlCancer

@PussySlayer Oh. I had forgotten. I wish O hadn't been reminded.

Snopes has two tricks in their toolbox: 
“unverified because we neglected to investigate information sent to us” and “we found a specific version of a common claim to be false and didn’t check more generally”


@slickpockets @miya @1w4kvra @PussySlayer Hierarchy is natural. Hierarchy within hierarchy is also natural.This is a poor argument to justify the mass importation of non-Whites.As for Aryan, I've always imagined people have different views on what that term means, so I avoid it.

@MKULTRADEMONjr @crushv We taking the boys out tonight, MK?

@1w4kvra @miya @PussySlayer It works because nobody in power will ever name the Jew.

@p @PussySlayer What do you use? Just straight up cmdline? I can't even remember how to create directories in cmd - kind of pisses me off tbh.I've got work to do. I've also been brushing up on my moonspeek for reasons...

@1w4kvra @IsaacWestcott @pussyslayer the jews have been trying to peddle the holocaust myth since the beginning of the last century. It was just one tool of many they used to push Zionism. For a lot of reasons, the post WW2 period was perfect to finally inject their propaganda deeply into the west and achieve their Zionist state, and by happenchancs they managed to get the holohoax to stick this time and become their poster child

@p @PussySlayer I've heard of juptyr - I should probably try it out.

@PussySlayer @p I can use python in my linux cmd; but I've never done scripting outside a pycharm lime environment.I've been reading/watching vids on the topic - but they've yet to go over anything I don't know

@1w4kvra @miya @PussySlayer Yeh, it's run dry.Stop cucking to it. In what context can it be mentioned where you can't say it's irrelevant?

@IsaacWestcott @1w4kvra @pussyslayer it’s relevant because it was one of the third Reich’s biggest mistakes. They were too soft and left themselves vulnerable. The holocaust didn’t happen, but it should’ve.

@PussySlayer @p If I can write basic scripts, I'm happy.I just am looking for a good python environment to code in.Some of us just want to organize data into spreadsheets or RDF DAMMIT!

@miya @1w4kvra @PussySlayer That's why I never invest energy into the holohoax. Who cares? It's irrelevant to now.If someone brings it up tell them as such.

@PussySlayer I heard about all that, just hadn't read the NYT.  Please to enjoy live footage of the VICE News ~pR0c3ss~.atecubanos--vice_news.webm

@PussySlayer @p What if they do "learn 2 code" and become your coworkers. :0010:

@miya @1w4kvra @PussySlayer The fact of the matter we are losing. Dying on a moral high ground is nothing to admire or romanticize.Until hordes can stop overwhelming us, and parasites stop subverting - we are the underman. Results matter, process does not.

@1w4kvra @miya @PussySlayer I have Jews at my workplace talking about "the lampshades." These people have no shame.

@1w4kvra @miya @PussySlayer Does Orthodoxy have the same issue as Western Christianity? They never adopted the "Judeo" prefix, correct?

@1w4kvra @miya @PussySlayer These types of "anti-Semites" are a dying breed. Christianity is on the way out - for better or for worse.Morals are written by the victor, nobody will honor us for losing gracefully - they will look back on us with contempt for being foolish.

@miya @1w4kvra @PussySlayer Are you suggesting mercy?

@1w4kvra @miya @PussySlayer Non-Whites like Whites more than Jews. In appearence, manner, and power. We could totally destroy them with a similar strategy.

@miya @1w4kvra @PussySlayer Altruism will always pave way for Jewish infiltration. Enough Whites will feel bad and let them in. As such this altruism must be shed, or any resulting order will succumb to the same subversion.Certainly Jews are toxic, but it is our own weakness that is the true root of this problem. If we did not have this blind altruism, there would be no Jewish subversion.

@1w4kvra @miya @PussySlayer Let's not make this about Hitler. Too often these discussions become about Hitler.That's Jew talk.

@PussySlayer @IsaacWestcott Common culture needs a common race

@miya @1w4kvra @PussySlayer Altruism is weakness. As long as we are altrustic we will tolerate problem groups and reach the same point.Whites have been losing ground for thousands of years because of tjis, colonialism was a fluke.Social Darwinism needs to be the premise of our next society - provided we don't get wiped due to our own incompetence this time around!

@IsaacWestcott @1w4kvra @pussyslayer democracy is cancerous but it worked relatively fine in an altruistic white ethnostate. The immigration act of 1965 was /not/ voted on by the people, it was forced down our throats and is directly responsible for the sudden radical change in US demographics. As always, the problem was letting the Jews in who hid under the sheepskin of fellow whites, they immediately started pushing their melting pot propaganda and were responsible for pushing the immigration act through. As Germany realized the key to a successful nation is 1. Ethnonationalism 2. removed entirely of the rotting infestation of Jewish parasitism. No good can be achieve when you have insiduous traitors scheming at all top levels.

@Oblivia こんにちは。チンチョンてなんで。Tusky_1549221668531_7AJCOQH0B2.…

@PussySlayer @IsaacWestcott I think that democracy is only possible in a monoethnic society in which various races have something in common with each other. In a multiethnic country democracy just degenerates into special interest pleading.

@1w4kvra @PussySlayer Limited voting can work, but the problem is once you've opened universal suffrage there is no going back.Authoritarianism is the medium by which a universal suffrage state(albeit ruled by oligarchs) is turned into an open oligarchy/aristocracy with the rulers out in the open.

@miyaHell nah.

@1w4kvra @PussySlayerI think Democracy is the issue. If we didn't have "tyranny of the majority" elites would not be encouraged to import a dependent class.By that same token, giving a ward of the state the right to vote how taxes will be administered is faulty on its face.  Because in Democracy you have to cater to the lowest common denominator policy is always reduced to soundbits:#BuildtheWall #Medicare4All #GasThemAll

@matrix I see that a life sentence was a mercy, the fucking furry degenerate.

@yolo Some SJW neck-beard was arguing this on facebook recently, like his ugly ass is going to ever get any anyway.

@chara @yolo *reinvented and work only for niggers

@jack @mrmcmayhem @p If you said it on a public instance I'd have forever thought you a fool.Good.

@jack @mrmcmayhem @p I don't like the idea of a gang, so much as I do some sort of identifier that could be used for us to know one another without having ever met.Something more eloquent and exclusive than a MAGA hat, and obviously not as outlandish as a swastika armband.It would appear more natural and possibly influence the behaviour of those around us who aren't in on it.

@jack @mrmcmayhem @p To hone in on one of these points before anything: Hezbollah.The Jews control most the press, optics are meaningless in regards to them. They'll just make it whatever they want.What have they accomplished? Their population dwindles, their territory shrinks, they have done effectively nothing.

@jack @mrmcmayhem Of course a police state just spawning would be no-good. The powers that be are not going to magically change their minds and go 1488. However, I don't even think it's possible. If Trump were to attempt such a thing - regardless where he falls in this - the left's pets and Jewish diaspora are so high on their own supply that they'd resist full force. Say what you will about soyboys, they are coordinated and organized.I don't see Hezbollah as something to aspire towards. What have they accomplished? Years and they have gained nothing. If we're forming gangs at the level things are far, far worse than we could have ever imagined. It's basically saying we've already lost.Furthermore, do you really see Whites as doing anything without being completely against the wall? I often find myself wondering if I should even lift a finger to help my people much of the time. Nobody else would take this bullshit, but ours keep swallowing it wholesale! The weakness makes me sick. The Covington Kids are attacked for being White with a spine? Every one avoids that fact and chalks it up to something else.Whites coordinated and connected? I'm surrounded by Jews and shabbos goy daily, it drives me nuts hearing them talk. I can only say so much without exposing myself, I've just been seeking promotions, kissing the right ass, and biding my time - it's been effective, but it's been YEARS of this! Like it or not the catalyst has to be political and national. Nothing else will unite these atomized individuals. If the national consciousness doesn't rise over the next few years it's over. I always run into excuses and fears as to what will happen to poor minorities, but never what's good for us, when talking with people. Until normal people will talk about this shit at the water cooler, we're done and our people are not worth defending.It's why I support migration. We may just have to become the next Jew - as disgusting as that is.@p WTF - SO MANY CHARACTERS! I MAY DO A WEEKLY RANT!

@MKULTRADEMONjr @judgedread @PussySlayer You certain about that?

@jack @mrmcmayhem As long as the (((oligarchs))) are no more at the end, a far-right police state is a fine temporary measure.

@matrix Veey cheesy, very 80s.

@PussySlayer Fuck you round eye, big wong for Chinese only!

@xeno @deorsum @levi @igeljaeger I agree 'he or she' is too clunky. I only use that phrase in official documents when I want to make someone feel uncomfortable without being seen as "exclusionary."'It' is a perfectly acceptable singular 3rd person pronoun - especially for something like animate/inanimate gems.From what you've said they use terms like '僕' and '俺' which are male exclusive. '私' can be either, but given the usage of the other 2 terms a more accurate translation would be he/him. If you've seen/heard 'あたし' it may be a little more complicated.I think it all really comes down to the agency of the translators. Perhaps thet wanted to be PC? Maybe they just didn't want to imply an all male gem society? They may also just have erroneously used 'they' as a singular without thinking on all these technicalities and rolled with it.

@MKULTRADEMONjr @PussySlayer @p Quite possibly. Tell him to sing Alabama Nigger and he may stroke.

@PussySlayer That's irritating. We got some precious networking years under Trump and some time to migrate...If people do it right the streetshitters can still be sent back.

@PussySlayer I've had hiring power before. Sure I could only give you an entry level $15/hr job. But it was unionized and you better believe I hired with the intent to change that factory from a jungle to a respectable place to work.I'm in a different job now, so no more hiring power, but I can decide who to teach well and who to neglect still xD

@yolo @Elizafox TBH, I'm not opposed to polygamy. Our best get multiple wives and ideally make more kids, and our worst leave the country to fuck other people's women - at least in theory.

@PussySlayer I honestly think we need to make a race neutral way to distinguish /our guys/ in politics.Just support AOC level taxes and healthcare. They won't know wtf to do! They can keep funding bith sides bx the right gives them tax cuts and faux resistance, while the left destroys society for them.

@chara @levi @yolo I'm willing to sacrafice degenerate Whites to the cold wastes of Alaska.

@chara @levi @yolo Asian invasion?

@chara @yolo @levi Texas has been turning, but it's not reached the point of being unwinnable at the national level.A large part of the Hispanic population aren't eligible voters. They make up 44%+ the population, but only 28% of voters.Each passing cycle it ticks - 2020 may be the first time it goes blue nationally.

@yolo @chara @levi During the transformation the state will become worse. Do you think Whites aren't already leaving Texas?I think that's the part people discount. As you lose a neighborhood, a district, Whites leave the state.I'm not certain you'll last a decade. Also most libs from my state have been moving to Texas for some reason. Not that I miss them xD

@xeno @igeljaeger Whatever you need to do. It's important to note translations are never perfect. I've begun reading FMA and Mirai Nikki in Japanese and the differences become obvious pretty fast.I am skeptical of the usage of singular they in Western languages. It's effectively used as a PC battering ram at this point. But I also didn't read the beginning of the conversation - too many words.

@matrix If you keep posting good, funny shit imma cut you.

@xeno @igeljaeger Singular they is used for fags. Also it is rarely used in Japanese.あいつ is singular they, but I've never seen it used. I've seen it's plural equivalent a few time: あいつら.Regardless the Japanese are more likely to omit pronouns when possible in conversation - this often includes manga/anime - unless going for added flare, in whuch case they would likely specify gender or use some archaic slang.I am prepared to defend my statement to the death!

@LOLIdemon @ArmchairFascist @jack Post some more pics and prostitute stats, make some more irreverent comparisons.You said you supported relationships with Asians, then none at all only prostitutes. At least be consistent.

@LOLIdemon @ArmchairFascist @jack Nobody mentioned morality, you macho man.

@LOLIdemon @ArmchairFascist @jack @p Then you're mot furthering your genetic line if your using condoms.Still not sure if troll or incel, but definitely an autist - his criteria changes every post.

@LOLIdemon @ArmchairFascist @jack You sound pretty controlled by sex. But sure, you're in control bud.

@ArmchairFascist @LOLIdemon @jack I'm either arguing with an Incel or a troll. Either way I've said my bit.

@LOLIdemon @jack You should look into Japanese court cases.It's amazing that MGTOW think throwing tantrums and then call those who call out their BS 'white knights.'I'd slap a bitch faster than you cpuld say white knight.

@LOLIdemon @jack Also, Anglin is a fag.

@LOLIdemon @jack I've been in relationships with both Asian and White women.Asian women are really fucking controlling. They are accustomed to managing finances and you'll be damned if you ask for a greater allowance.There is no such thing as a perfect relationship, the myth that Asian women are passive really fools people.If you you're in a relationship with a thot tell her to fuck off.Everyone, men and women, think they deserve the world these days. The problem is courts favor women - and that's not exclusive to the west.If you can't get a good white girl you probably can't get a good asian girl either. People want quality partners, not spoiled brats.

@jack @LOLIdemon MaxDegen yo.

Asus Jew'd me! I go to install my SSD, no fucking screws came in the PC nor with my drive!Guess I got to go buy some screws :0080:

@djsumdog @foxhkron Throwing boiling water on the ice looked pretty sweet briefly, but it is yet to freeze.What a disappointment.

@ArmchairFascist @jack @PussySlayer @judgedread  I wonder how long many of the 'Pro' status people are going to last on Gab.This is accelerating quickly. I've only had ~7 notifications today.

@PussySlayer Very professional of him to post screencaps of people he's banned.

@crushv I see me in there!

@judgedread @jack Thevfact that the Media and FBI have become such a politicized entity really helped stir the pot on the Vegas shooter.I mean, we knew more about a smiling teenager in 24 hours than we know about the shooter now.

@p @LOLIdemon @Creepella @PussySlayer I have an interesting history with relationships to say the least... a few maybe-babies in China being the least interesting/controversial among them.

@PussySlayer @LOLIdemon the machine spirit will be most pleased.

@PussySlayer @LOLIdemon I've done some tsv file generation from RDF using python, but that was more out of necessity than interest.I'd like to learn to use a twitter api to track the use of certain Japanese words - FOR REASONS!

@LOLIdemon @PussySlayer Are we playing reverse 20 questions?

@PussySlayer @LOLIdemon I choose the wrong field to specialize in early on.Medical start-ups cost too damn much. That's why I'm a humble bureaucrat now, albeit with a bad ass title. Hence why I'm trying to #learn2code and tinkering with my machines.

@PussySlayer @LOLIdemon If I had a couple million I'd not need to know how it works, I'd just need a few good people who do.The point of a CEO isn't to code or construct physical servers, it's to find the people who whip code monkeys and build things.

@LOLIdemon @PussySlayer That seems too intense for a man who spends all of his time reading the Tales of Genji.But if he manages to isolate #Qtards I'm ok with it.

@LOLIdemon @PussySlayer Exactly. So provided he actually got a couple million, couldn't he have started a basic web hosting service so Rob Manchild can't whisper worse ideas in his ear; or do companies like goDaddy not own their own servers anyway?

@LOLIdemon @PussySlayer How much money does it take to start up a domain registrar and web hosting service?Godaddy is only worth like 200mil and they are a big boy right?

@PussySlayer Gib money pl0x. Need to defend #Q.

@PussySlayer @p @Sadshark Also if my avi isn't telling enough xD

@PussySlayer @p @Sadshark I talk enough politics elsewhere. It's nice to just have a place to chill.

@p @Sadshark Do you have the 5th wedge? Radical Centrists?

@matrix @p @levi We must assimilate Sunshine land via extensive mating rituals!

@p @saga @levi @dirb @nerthos To be fair that shits good.

@p @levi Geographically, perhaps, but the demographics are definitely against you.Northern and eastern California are nice; but that's maybe 1/3 the population.

@p @levi I can travel across my state in the time you pass 100,000 Mexicans - which is how I assume you say 1 mile in California - pay $11 to fill my tank, and I don't pay taxes when I get food to go!

@Creepella @PussySlayer @judgedread @p MetroPCS is cheap. We have 3 smart phones with near unlimited data for $80 a month.I get a complimentary $200 upgrade every year, so it's a decent phone always.

@Creepella @PussySlayer @judgedread @p I think the wear is intentional. They need you buying $90 chargers for your new hot pile of crap.

@p @levi I mean, the whole LA area is pretty shit too - sorry bud. But SF ain't helping.

@PussySlayer @judgedread @Creepella @p Apple doesn't even hide that they are fucking you.They make you replace everything with every version, down to the fucking wire!

@PussySlayer @Creepella @judgedread @jack I didn't either. I feel so unsexy.

@p @levi @dirb @nerthos That south west looking sketch af

@sir I support getting off FB, but does it even actually delete your data?I've heard it just archives it, excluding personal identifiers, on a server in case you want to use it in the future. But the wording on what counted as an identifier was pretty vague.

@PussySlayer @judgedread Under the guidance of Q no doubt :0160:

@judgedread @PussySlayer Looks the the Russian porn bots have been defeated. Gab just loaded in under a second.

Factory resetting my pc. First step on the way to Linux. Let's wipe this drive!

@PussySlayer @Creepella @p It's stories like these that make me happy I don't live anywhere near the shitties.

@PussySlayer I can't even load a single page. 404 and worse 90% of the time.

@PussySlayer If people didn't think Gab was bad before, they do now. I get a '404 "no big deal"' like every other page now.This is not merely the work of Russian Porn Bots - which are ignoring me btw!

@PussySlayer Took me awhile, I was busy. xD

Geo-cities is jp only now? Wow.

Hello I posted a post!

@PussySlayer It's definitely a unique UI and not just trying to poorly mimic Twitter, like some other platforms.

@PussySlayer Yo. I like the infinite scrolling here. Was that by design or did they wait for Gab to do it?
