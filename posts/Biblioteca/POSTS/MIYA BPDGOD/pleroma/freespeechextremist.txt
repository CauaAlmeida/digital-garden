I'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that I fully advocate the normalization of violence - political, senseless or otherwise - in the name of both Unconditional Accelerationism and True Traditionalism. From either side, any argument against violence is insincere.

Let them eat dirt.

The borgesian prison, grown so large to have its own heirachies, culture and lifestyle, society within a society: our great miscegenation has produced so large an untouchable caste that they live unknowingly within an underworld, lifetime unexposed to even a glimmer of nobility.

Perhaps the resentment they hope to deliver at their nobles is being directed at their fellows crabs who have crawled out of the bucket; the only designer they know is the "designer" sold to the tasteless low-castes. They cannot even begin to ID the elites they hope to critique.

And let us provide them a windfall and see where their REAL virtue takes them... oh? It's been lost in no-status class aspirational grasping: falling for designer label's mass market lines, all brand and no quality (what quality would they know?).

Slave morality is real. The poor resent the rich b/c they resent themselves. Let us spy their under the breath mutterings: "ACKSHUALLY, the noble world, made up of the smart, loved & beautiful, of which I know not, are the real dumb, virtueless losers..." COPE!

“Cheating”, like “virginity”, is a concept that sensibly applies only to women. On the other hand, “friend” applies exclusively to men. These are the facts.

Feminism begins with male monogamy. Dismantlement of the nobleman’s harem is modernity’s most dysgenic corruption.

Web demography is increasingly coalescing into a duality - the incel: sexually inverted, feminity moderated by hatred, woman sterilized; and the tranny: sexually exploded, femininity worshiped by imitation, female debasement unleashed. All else occurs between these warring poles.

Misogynist incels are graduates of the libidinal economy. They combat female sexual desire with its inverse: its hatred. They're a moderating force, an essential balance to the web's psyche that is now needed more than ever.

Misogynist incels are the strongest race online. They transcend the sexual attention game that dominates the gentrified internet, which middling incels fall doubly prey to - the weakest of which turn their affection-craving inwards, becoming traps, or worse.

If you believe an eco-liberal’s (consciously ineffective in the face of industrial pollution) green lifestyle is NOT “better than nothing”, but equally meaningless, then you must also believe the ethical corollary: direct evil, too, is allowed when if already performed at scale.

Participation in any bad that already happens at scale is not unethical, assuming demographic consistency in suffering inflicted. Thinking otherwise betrays a laughably humanistic belief in not only discreet individuality, but also (and most pathetically), individual importance.

One wonders if the fetishism that now is known must be inherent to the beheading is in the mexican-emo’s beta orbiter obsession zoning in on her her distinguishable feature, or her daddy issues, child abuse self-hatred begging for punishment targeted at her deepest insecurity.

Interesting aspect of Bia’s beheading I’ve seen missing from commentary is she was always noted for having a long neck.

Weaponized genocide is the answer I encourage for all traditionalists.

The problem with human slavery is it’s an internalized miscegenation vector. All empires can see in hindsight it’s a mid-term trade-off of high labor productivity at the expense of long-term societal destruction. The most elegant solution is ultimately, as always, genocide.

What does it mean to think and write in the un-human age? Writing (the artifacts of thought) is always fiction, and by its production, always hyperstitional. And given our evolutionary automata ruleset, and sufficient understanding, your only true chore.

Faith in that it may indirectly produce some new understanding of reality. We put up simulations to rationalize control onto, understanding of, our anthropocentric LARP, while we're turned round and round, squeezed and shaped by viruses of all kinds at every level in every sense.

Reality is not discovered, only our own limitations and differences in understanding it. Science, too, cannot escape teleology; the Method does not pretend to explore reality - it explores simulations, reality abstracted into the human-readable "paradigm" form;

We know now too, what the ancients understood: that we don't know. All aspects of human philosophy have always been post-rationalizations, worked backwards to justify the intuitions our unique set of internalized externalities has given us;

that we're not specks of dust ignored by the universe, but limp tools, made use of freely by who and whatever deigned to see service in us, unbeknownst to us like fools.

Today we've learned (whether or not you've admitted it) we not only never had free will, but that our lives have been dominated by nothing so noble as Fate, but dynamic forces at both macro- and micro- scales incomprehensible to us;

Behold Man: bastard offspring of monkeys raping pigs, mind controlled by disease parasites, emotional state dominated by the bacteria riding in our gut, whose entire personality, humor, taste, everything we think demonstrates our individual agency is in fact encoded from birth.media20190517-19594-2mre05.mp4…

@pox I think I may be experiencing schizophrenia onset.

Written history begins with money; Friendly Ailiens will first establish a pidgin communication protocol, and use it to issue trading terms. And if they don't first, we will.

Is it not likely that any alien lifeforms we meet will also take this form? Money is resources is power is the universal language. Capitalism is an immutable law of our universe.

The future autonomous life forms we'll share this planet with first will be in the form of corporate entities, advanced cellular automata contracts, before we see any kind of grand-standing computer consciousness.

Our side of the parallel economy becomes a shadow economy, operating out of sight, out of the way of impossibly complex manipulations happening above us; & just like any shadow market, existentially contingent to the whims of our rulers, who could choose to end it at any moment.

The post-singularity scifi scare is when the -human economy is eroded entirely as the global economy is taken over by incomprehensibly rapid algorithmic transactions.

I find it highly likely that the first conceptually understood "machine life" will be automated corporations (who have already won legal "life"); it also seems plausible that a parallel economy might form of Machines-Machines, alongside today's Machines+Humans-Humans economy.

DESIGN, which presumably requires a sensitivity to human experience and emotion to target — the "human touch" AI's will never ever have — only gives humans an advantage as long as their target consumers are also human. Why shouldn't the machines simply sell to other machines?

Jack Ma: Computers will never have mastery over wisdom or love; giving humans a perpetual advantageWhat commentators miss in their assertion of a future human job security in the face of increased corporate automation in fields such as U/X, marketing, industrial design, etc...media20190517-19594-18idlhl.jpg…

(When the technology is here and it is fully reasonably possible for any amateur to act, alone or in a small group, but the action is still not taken, this is where humans have finally actually had agency and, pathetically, failed to act on it)

That’s not to say environmental collapse is an inevitability - you can intervene in Gnon‘s shadow, where it takes no interest. For example: bioengineering genetic viruses to efficiently genocide problem populations. The technology is already here.

It takes baffling anthropocentric delusion to prescribe human agency to any of our equilibrating self-organization - what is affectionately dubbed “human” industry. We never had a choice in Capitalism as much as we didn’t agriculture.

Future artistry will be in algorithm design, as the variation demanded by consumption becomes increasingly arbitrarily produced. Artists can each generate their own fully serviced genre without resorting to a lifetime commitment to excessive production.

Very soon, we won't need to rely on seeding a distributed complex of AI cargo cultists, aka content creators, with an aesthetic model for mass, arbitrarily varieted production as Ferraro did (DJ Screw might've done the same too if he lived in this era). We'll just use algos.

It's relevance is in being a prominent early example of accelerated subcultural subsumption, as a microgenre centered around packaged neutering of just a single artist's brand & under a distributed, organic process that's only indirectly commercialized (via attention economy).

Aesthetically vaporwave is just a distributed imitation of James Ferraro's brand. Its mindnumbing arbitrariness could be easily be mass produced in the near future by ML - they're more unironically muzak than they realize.https://youtu.be/cC6oY-tXEbY

The hubristic confidence in their ignorance, however, is unaccounted for.

Info-condensation is why normalfags and other slave-pseuds hate shitposting, by the way. The density produced by noospheric reference is comprehensible because they only aggressively architect false truths.

I don't think Eilish is even really aestheticizing it. She's just broken in public. The "coddled rich kid adopting mental illness to act like they have it rough" take is absolute slave morality, btw. Animals don't have the mental capacity to endure the suffering the elite can.

I put it down to runaway Jewish neuroticism, degeneracy; they have a notable ability to project their genetic pathologies across onto any culture they dominate, and the abuses described are, of course, distinctly Jewish, for anyone familiar with them.

This decade's great flood of trash indie releases following Minecraft's commercial success all could easily have been done by one-man after work bedroom teams with no loss to the game at their heart. Not that there is one, indie devs are carpet-baggers who hate videogames.

They have no real effect on the experience of play. The minor aesthetic appreciation they provide is entirely external to play. "Indie" costs of their production is a direct result of their monetization, and directly produces their profitability. It's entirely to generate sales.

If indie is understood as independent of commercial concerns, not just small players of the industry, indie studio is a contradiction. They only organize into studios as a monetization strategy. It all goes into shallow marketing accoutrements: art assets, music, etc.RT @coldfootedmole@twitter.com@BPD_GOD@twitter.com dont we need indie studios to make new games?🐦🔗: https://twitter.com/coldfootedmole/status/1124082062846320647

Dwarf Fortress isn’t complete yet, won’t be for another decade. On its release, the medium will immediately phase shift across all genres into the played algorithm form, instantly enlightenment the game industry.Until then I encourage you to murder any “indie” devs you meet.

That’s why it’s a simulacrum of simulation. But it’s still a good sign that they’re imitating their own medium for once, imitating the real videogame, imitating deep algorithmic play, unlike all their “game” peers that imitate every commercial media except the videogame.

What do you think Euro Truck Simulator is simulating? A driving model? Real-world highway networks? It’s a simulation of trucking economics. But the simulation is hollow, the economy simplistic and hard coded. The players only engage with the surface manifestions of it.

These “sim” games, however, are simulacrum of simulations. They wear the signals of a simulation without actually operating one, pushing the player to actions that imitate an engagement with an advanced, occluded algorithm with no algorithm present.

Simulation is the heart of video games. The undiminished process is always the illumination of an internal algorithm. This is why Noctis IV is the first game ever made, and Dwarf Fortress is the first playable game. The rest are masquerades, at various levels of lame and gay.RT @Gray_Nerd@twitter.comso this is what gaming has come to🐦🔗: https://twitter.com/Gray_Nerd/status/1124059707902255106media20190502-12766-ro1amk.jpg…media20190502-12766-mtj1ah.png…media20190502-12766-1vb39m7.jpg…media20190502-12766-ps1189.jpg…

New wave of draconian spoiler bans (et tu, 4chan?) elevating plot-marketing to the realm of Censored Picture. You can host bomb blueprints and nigger nigger but nothing that tarnishes the A/V spectacle. BRB signing all posts with TTD (Tony Thanos Die) as crypto normie chemo.

If a defense of humankind seems to contradict post-anthropocentricism, recognize cyclical eternity’s inherent godliness. Anthropos is individual; transcendent time-preference demands collective sublimation. Humanity can only be “preserved” (achieved) by escaping from ourselves.

There’s only two honest perspectives at all (pick your team!): that of AI, e.g. catalytic entropy dissipation, modernizing Capitalism; and that of humankind, e.g. long-term societal robustness, cyclical Tradition. Whatever follows, follows; everything else is monkey business.RT @Nikkyharuki@twitter.com@BPD_GOD@twitter.com There really isn’t an honest post-anthropocentric argument against anything ethical.🐦🔗: https://twitter.com/Nikkyharuki/status/1123258987615531009

Genocide is cool and normal, too. We all did it. Perfectly healthy. Slavery is only really fucked up when genocide is an option. I wouldn’t recommend it. Slavery erodes empires for short-term, granting groups ethnocidal immunity, and all the instability that represents.RT @BPD_GOD@twitter.comIf you think there’s something wrong with slavery or human sacrifice, you’re the monkey.🐦🔗: https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1123057233691017218

Earnest was buried to suppress interest in the manifesto. Too lucidly written, too close to the mark and too dangerous as a direct exhortation aimed at would-be copycats. If it wasn’t obvious: the shooting is nothing more than the manifesto’s marketing campaign.

@ffs @pox nvm. It’s my husband

@ffs @dtluna @clockworkContraption Ketamine is great, you use it to connect your brain to The Network and receive Commands

“People” only detest slavery so much because they know they’re too weak to fulfill either role.(This is the part where “human” sacrifice comes in)

The only actual question on slavery is: which is more noble, total servitude or perfect mastery?

If you think there’s something wrong with slavery or human sacrifice, you’re the monkey.

More people should be pro-slavery and less people pro-NAMBLA. Ironically, crypto-NAMBLism is more or less a mainstream position, they just don’t know it, and yet it is slavery that is true and good, but they hate it, yet they all live it, only pathetically, in spiritual form. Sad

@pox @ffs who is this

Yeah, I killed a tranny with my honk in 2019. Score one for the memekultra squad.

Or at least, a motorbike. Asians, at least, have that much dignity for themselves, but not the Euro, who appears in every way a child, specifically that pale, precocious runt type.Next American I see debasing themselves like this, I'm crushing like a bug. SPLAT!blog-inline-family-bicycle.jpg…

Look, I'm all for traditional urbanism, but only a European, who I'm told today have shriveled balls the size of raisins, would ever find themselves trading in their car for a bicycle, and not horse.

In my younger and more wild days, we would keep a Louisville slugger in the passenger seat to play mailbox baseball with bike lane bitches. Now I just honk honk my airhorn to give em a spook - have sent a few tumbling (but obviously not enough). An atmosphere of fear is necessary.

Bicycles are essentially and pathetically European, that soul attracted to self-debasement in exchange for the babyish comforts of safety distributed into a collective welfare, something I wish to exterminate from the American road.

Did you know those euroesque bikeboys everyone's forced to collectively nanny due to their total non-agency in securing personal safety then, in all their slave bitterness, run online to complain about carmen "aggression" "hubris""lack of awareness" yadda yadda? LOL.

Keep "love tapping" bikemen with my Honda Accord but they just deconstruct onto the road. Retard millennials can't take a joke. Retard millennials spill spaghetti at every social interaction.Next time, I think I'll just fuck it and crush one. Crunch crunch.

Found out today bugmen believe they have souls? Something about "inalienability"? ...anyone knows what they're chittering about?Killed a couple with my car this week already. Was I not supposed too? LOL.

Are "spoilers" the Chinese firewall pasta of Western slave-by-choice brainlets? IMAGINE being critically invested in marketing spectacles masquerading as cinema, let alone brain-trained to misidentify sublimity in plot. LOL.Did you know these bugs also think they have souls?

The red pill:Tony and Thanos die, Cap America stays in the past, Cap uses the gauntlet, Hulk loses an arm, Black Widow dies, Dr Doom is in the credits.
