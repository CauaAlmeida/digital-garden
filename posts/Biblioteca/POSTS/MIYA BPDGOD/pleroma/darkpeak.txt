@sir diversifying your payment processors is important too. Can you self host?

@sir how does it differ from librepay

@laura this is a joke on how they force the EU regulated “cookie consent” down your throat, hypocritically performing the same things the lead is criticizing, right?

@karolat @yolo @zemichi there’s nothing wrong with children’s books. There is something wrong with being emotionally and intellectually attached to a pulp children’s book enough that as an adult it can be used to manipulate you. There’s also something wrong with young adult fiction being the only books you’ve read and can use as a literary reference.

@zemichi @yolo it’s just the upper limit of the average liberal’s reading level and a popular phenomenon contemporary to the impressionable age range, allowing its manipulation to be a shared, common vector of propaganda. It’s content aren’t relevant. It’s literally a children’s book.

@tateisu @shadowfacts @dgold @WAHa_06x36 @tootapp @Gargron @charlag @lain Pleroma devs had communicated to the dev before and were open about their intentions with this change. The Toot! dev responded that he didnt care what Pleroma does and ignored their plans, and now he’s dealing with the consequences.

@Arch @xeno @karolat @djsumdog @p @karolat @Echolocation I have the opposite opinion, imo personal blocking should be disabled, except for DMs. It makes conversation confused and broken. If it becomes normalized within networks that interact deeply with each other, it’ll eventually make basic conversation impossible since everyone’s experience of the dialogue would unique.Really, blocking /should/ be done by instances, and only them. The instance admins should be allowed to block both entire instances and individuals. And it should always be completely transparent who’ve they’ve chosen to block (and ideally, why). Finally, and essentially, users should be able to migrate easily between instances, just as easily as changing their display name.The result would be a moderation-subscription model. Users look at the different, fully transparent moderation policies, and their block lists, and decide which fits their taste. If you don’t like someone and your instance doesn’t want to block him, instead of risking the clarity of conversation for the entire network just for your own personal problems, you should instead migrate to a more accommodating instance. Self segregation is perfectly fine and a health expression of federation. Breaking communication at an individual level ain’t. If a personal blocking function really is necessary, it should be limited and like a filter, that still shows there’s a hidden message in the conversation and gives you the ability to view it if you want to, so you at least have some awareness that the conversation thread is broken.
